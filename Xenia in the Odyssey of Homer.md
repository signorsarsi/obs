Abstract

 Xenia

 "as a #ital thread in the social $abric o$ both the %omeric "orld and the eighth centuryBC. %o"e#er& due to its #ery importance and due to the changing en#ironment o$ the "orld in"hich %omer "as composing&

 xenia

is $lagged as a cause $or concern in %omer through the portrayal o$ certain characters& situations and relationships' e(amples o$

 xenia

 appear throughout the

Odyssey

 and are persistently problematic. )hrough these e(amples o$

 xenia,

%omer inspires a discussion about it& "hich implies that it "as #ulnerable to abuse and change&and that the boundaries o$ such relationships "ere not concretely de$ined. %omer demonstratesthat

 xenia

 "as a "ay o$ gauging the le#el o$ ci#ilisation o$ a community& "hich \*dysseus mustidenti$y as he encounters ne" and alien groups on his #oyage and must either depend on their hospitality or escape $rom their enmity. %omer also uses certain e(amples o$

 xenia

to de$inethat it "as a personal relationship rather than as a system o$ e(change that could bene$it a "ider community. %e places

 xenia

on a spectrum o$ e(change& "hich encompasses concerns about itsrelation to trade and piracy. )hroughout&

 xenia

is $lagged as a concept o$ huge importance& yetalso o$ huge concern& and thus an essential issue $or discussion in the epic.2

 xenia

 as a term that represents the gi$ts or meal bet"eenguest and host. It can be used $or both public and pri#ate acts o$ hospitality. %o"e#er&speci$ically the neuter plural&   45& denotes the acts o$ hospitality& "hereas the singular $eminine 45

denotes the concept o$ hospitality.

Be$ore continuing& a short note is reuired on "hat is meant by 9the %omeric "orld0.)he "orld in "hich the %omeric epics are set and the "orld "hich they describe seem to present a dichotomy in time periods.

 )he date $or the $all o$ )roy is suggested as 118: BC&there$ore the

should be set in that year& and the

 o#er the course o$ the t"entyyears $ollo"ing the $all o$ )roy. %o"e#er& archaeological and literary e#idence indicates thatthe "orld re$lected in %omer0s epics is $rom the archaic period& in "hich great socialtrans$ormation "as ta,ing place. Poetic te(ts o$$er us a representation o$ "hat happens outsidethe "orld o$ te(tual production& rather than a re$lection o$ it& demonstrating challenges&rein$orcements and interpretations o$ the cultural "or,ings surrounding their composition.

 )he"orld o$ the %omeric epics and the "orld "hich they describe is a composite o$ time periodsand perceptions o$ time periods. +ithin the te(ts themsel#es& there seems to be an internalunderstanding o$ the historical conte(t& as %omer describes the heroes0 ability to thro"enormous stones that "ould be beyond the strength o$ men in the contemporary age.
