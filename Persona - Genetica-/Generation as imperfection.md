According to [[Giulio Cesare Vannini]]  in [[Dialogus de Deo]]  from  [[De admirandis naturae reginae deaque mortalium arcanis]] (363)

" According to [[Empedocles]] the world perpetuates itself by means of [[generation]]  . However perpetuity is perfection because it is based on the same concept of eternity. Because eternity and continuum are  one same thing. On the contrary [[generation]] is impefection and it is based on the principle of [[movement]] . Although movement is perfection  of the mobile being, it does not exist absolutely, but only inasmuch it is mobile. So movement comes to perfection by the means of rest."
