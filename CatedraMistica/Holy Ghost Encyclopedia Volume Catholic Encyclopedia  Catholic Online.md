### I. SYNOPSIS OF THE DOGMA

The doctrine of the [Catholic](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2678) Church concerning the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) forms an integral part of her teaching on the [mystery](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8298) of the Holy Trinity, of which St. Augustine (De Trin., I, iii, 5), speaking with diffidence, says: "In no other subject is the danger of erring so great, or the progress so difficult, or the fruit of a careful study so appreciable". The essential points of the [dogma](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3937) may be resumed in the following propositions:

-   The [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is the Third [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) of the Blessed Trinity.
-   Though really distinct, as a Person, from the Father and the Son, He is consubstantial with Them; being [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) like Them, He possesses with Them one and the same Divine Essence or Nature.
-   He proceeds, not by way of generation, but by way of spiration, from the Father and the Son together, as from a single principle.

Such is the [belief](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1667) the [Catholic](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2678) [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) demands.

### II. CHIEF ERRORS

All the theories and all the [Christian](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2927) sects that have contradicted or impugned, in any way, the [dogma](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3937) of the Trinity, have, as a logical consequence, threatened likewise the [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) in the Holy Ghost. Among these, history mentions the following:

-   In the second and third centuries, the dynamic or modalistic [Monarchians](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8086) (certain Ebionites, it is said, Theodotus of Byzantium, Paul of Samosata, Praxeas, Noëtus, Sabellius, and the Patripassians generally) held that the same Divine Person, according to His different operations or manifestations, is in turn called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; so they recognized a purely nominal Trinity.
-   In the fourth century and later, the Arians and their numerous heretical offspring: Anomans or Eunomians, Semi-Arians, Acacians, etc., while admitting the triple personality, denied the consubstantiality. [Arianism](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1055) had been preceded by the Subordination theory of some ante-Nicene writers, who affirmed a difference and a gradation between the Divine Persons other than those that arise from their relations in point of origin.
-   In the sixteenth century, the Socinians explicitly rejected, in the name of reason, along with all the mysteries of Christianity, the doctrine of Three Persons in One God.
-   Mention may also be made of the teachings of Johannes Philoponus (sixth century), Roscellinus, Gilbert de la Porrée, [Joachim of Flora](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6342) (eleventh and twelfth centuries), and, in modern times, Günther, who, by denying or obscuring the doctrine of the numerical [unity](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11813) of the Divine Nature, it reality set up a triple deity.

In addition to these systems and these writers, who came in conflict with the true doctrine about the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) only indirectly and as a logical result of previous errors, there were others who attacked the [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) directly:

-   Towards the middle of the fourth century, Macedonius, [Bishop](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1918) of Constantinople, and, after him a number of Semi-Arians, while apparently admitting the Divinity of the Word, denied that of the Holy Ghost. They placed Him among the spirits, inferior ministers of God, but higher than the angels. They were, under the name of Pneumatomachians, condemned by the Council of Constantinople, in 381 ( Mansi, III, col. 560).
-   Since the days of Photius, the schismatic Greeks maintain that the Holy Ghost, true [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) like the Father and the Son, proceeds from the former alone.

### III. THE THIRD PERSON OF THE BLESSED TRINITY

This heading implies two truths:

-   The [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is a [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) really distinct as such from the Father and the Son;
-   He is [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and consubstantial with the Father and the Son.

The first statement is directly opposed to Monarchianism and to [Socinianism](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10920) ; the second to Subordinationism, to the different forms of Arianism, and to Macedonianism in particular. The same arguments drawn from [Scripture](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10624) and Tradition may be used generally to prove either assertion. We will, therefore, bring forward the proofs of the two truths together, but first call particular attention to some passages that demonstrate more explicitly the distinction of personality.

A. [Scripture](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10624)

In the [New Testament](https://www.catholic.org/bible/new_testament.php) the word [spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) and, perhaps, even the expression [spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) signify at times the [soul](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10963) or [man](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7463) himself, inasmuch as he is under the influence of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and aspires to things above; more frequently, especially in St. Paul, they signify [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) acting in [man](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7463) ; but they are used, besides, to designate not only a working of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) in general, but a Divine Person, Who i&neither the Father nor the Son, Who is named together with the Father, or the Son, or with Both, without the context allowing them to be identified. A few instances are given here. We read in John, xiv, 16, 17: "And I [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with, you for ever. The [spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of truth, whom the world cannot receive"; and in John, xv, 26: "But when the [Paraclete](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8966) cometh, whom I [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) send you from the Father, the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me." St. Peter addresses his first epistle, i, 1-2, "to the strangers dispersed . . . elect, according to the foreknowledge of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto [obedience](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8604) and sprinkling of the blood of [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) ". The [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of consolation and of [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) is also clearly distinguished in [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 16:7, 13-15, from the Son, from Whom He receives all He is to teach the Apostles, and from the Father, who has nothing that the Son also does not possess. Both send Him, but He is not separated from Them, for the Father and the Son come with Him when He descends into our souls ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 14:23 ).

Many other texts declare quite as clearly that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is a Person, a [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) distinct from the Father and the Son, and yet One [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) with Them. In several places St. Paul speaks of Him as if speaking of God. In [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 28:25, he says to the [Jews](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6511) : "Well did the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) speak to our fathers by [Isaias](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6193) the [prophet](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9674) "; now the [prophecy](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9674) contained in the next two verses is taken from [Isaias](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6193) 6:9-10, where it is put in the mouth of the "King the [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) of hosts". In other places he uses the words [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) as plainly synonymous. Thus he writes, I Corinthians 3:16: "Know you not, that you are the [temple](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11357) of God, and that the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) dwelleth in you?" and in 6:19: "Or know you not, that your members are the [temple](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11357) of the Holy Ghost, who is in you . . . ?" [St. Peter](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5358) asserts the same identity when he thus remonstrates with Ananias ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 5:3-4 ): "Why hath [Satan](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3815) tempted thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) . . . ? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God." The sacred writers attribute to the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) all the works characteristic of Divine power. It is in His name, as in the name of the Father and of the Son, that [baptism](https://www.catholic.org/prayers/sacrament.php?id=1) is to be given ( [Matthew](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=47) 28:19 ). It is by His operation that the greatest of Divine mysteries , the Incarnation of the Word, is accomplished ( [Matthew](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=47) 1:18, 20 ; [Luke](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=49) 1:35 ). It is also in His name and by His power that sins are forgiven and souls sanctified: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them" ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 20:22-23 ); "But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) Christ, and the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of our God" ( [1 Corinthians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=53) 6:11 ); "The charity of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us" ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 5:5 ). He is essentially the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 14:16-17 ; 15:26 ), Whose office it is to strengthen [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 6:5 ), to bestow [wisdom](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=27) ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 6:3 ), to give testimony of Christ, that is to say, to confirm His teaching inwardly ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 15:26 ), and to teach the [Apostles](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=933) the full meaning of it ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 14:26 ; 16:13 ). With these [Apostles](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=933) He [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) abide for ever ( [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 14:16 ). Having descended on them at Pentecost, He [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) guide them in their work ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 8:29 ), for He [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) inspire the new prophets ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 11:28 ; 13:9 ), as He inspired the Prophets of the Old [Law](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6916) ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 7:51 ). He is the source of graces and [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) ( [1 Corinthians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=53) 12:3-11 ); He, in particular, grants the gift of tongues ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 2:4 ; 10:44-47 ). And as he dwells in our bodies sanctifies them ( [1 Corinthians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=53) 3:16 ; 6:19 ),so [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) and them he raise them again, one day, from the dead ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 8:11 ). But he operates especially in the soul, giving it a new [life](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7101) ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 8:9 sq. ), being the pledge that [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) has given us that we are his [children](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=28) ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 8:14-16 ; [2 Corinthians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=54) 1:22 ; 5:5 ; [Galatians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=55) 4:6 ). He is the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of God, and at the same [time](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11571) the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 8:9 ); because He is in God, He knows the deepest mysteries of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ( [1 Corinthians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=53) 2:10-11 ), and He possesses all knowledge. St. Paul ends his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (13:13) with this formula of benediction, which might be called a [blessing](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1948) of the Trinity: "The [grace](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5305) of our [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) , and the charity of God, and the communication of the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) be with you all." -- Cf. Tixeront, "Hist. des dogmes", Paris, 1905, I, 80, 89, 90,100,101.



B. Tradition

While corroborating and explaining the testimony of Scripture, Tradition brings more clearly before us the various stages of the evolution of this doctrine.

As early as the first century, St. Clement of [Rome](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10148) gives us important teaching about the Holy Ghost. His "Epistle to the Corinthians" not only tells us that the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) inspired and guided the holy writers (viii, 1; xlv, 2); that He is the voice of [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) speaking to us in the [Old Testament](https://www.catholic.org/bible/old_testament.php) (xxii, 1 sq.); but it contains further, two very explicit statements about the Trinity. In c. xlvi, 6 (Funk, "Patres apostolici", 2nd ed., I,158), we read that "we have only one God, one Christ, one only [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [grace](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5305) within us, one same vocation in Christ". In lviii, 2 (Funk, ibid., 172), the author makes this solemn [affirmation](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=277) ; zo gar ho theos, kai zo ho kyrios Iesous Christos kai to pneuma to hagion, he te pistis kai he elpis ton eklekton, oti . . . which we may compare with the formula so frequently met with in the [Old Testament](https://www.catholic.org/bible/old_testament.php) : zo kyrios. From this it follows that, in Clement's view, kyrios was equally applicable to ho theos (the Father), ho kyrios Iesous Christos , and to pneuma to hagion ; and that we have three witnesses of equal authority, whose Trinity, moreover, is the [foundation](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4807) of [Christian](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2927) [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) and hope.

The same doctrine is declared, in the second and third centuries, by the lips of the martyrs, and is found in the writings of the Fathers. [St. Polycarp](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=6600) (d. 155), in his torments, thus professed his [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) in the Three Adorable Persons ("Martyrium sancti Polycarpi" in Funk op. cit., I, 330): " [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) Almighty, Father of Thy blessed and well beloved Son, [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) Christ. . . in everything I praise Thee, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee by the eternal and celestial pontiff [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) Christ, Thy well beloved Son, by whom, to Thee, with Him and with the Holy Ghost, [glory](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5201) now and for ever!"

St. Epipodius spoke more distinctly still (Ruinart, "Acta mart.", [Verona](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11990) edition, p. 65): "I confess that [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) is [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) with the Father and the Holy Ghost, and it is fitting that I should give back my [soul](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10963) to Him Who is my Creator and my Redeemer."

Among the apologists, [Athenagoras](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1203) mentions the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) along with, and on the same plane as, the Father and the Son. "Who would not be astonished", says he (Legat. pro christian., n. 10, in P.G., VI, col. 909), "to hear us called atheists, us who confess [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) the Father, [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) the Son and the Holy Ghost, and hold them one in power and distinct in order \[. . . ten en te henosei dynamin, kai ten en te taxei diairesin \]?"



Theophilus of Antioch, who sometimes gives to the Holy Ghost, as to the Son, the name of [Wisdom](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=27) (sophia), mentions besides (Ad Autol., lib. I, n. 7, and II, n. 18, in P.G., VI, col. 1035, 1081) the three terms theos, logos, sophia and, being the first to apply the characteristic word that was afterwards adopted, says expressly (ibid., II, 15) that they [form](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4781) a trinity ( trias ).

Irenæus looks upon the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) as eternal (Adv. Hær., V, xii, n. 2, in P.G., VII, 1153), existing in [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ante omnem constitutionem, and produced by him at the beginning of His ways (ibid., IV, xx, 3). Considered with regard to the Father, the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is his [wisdom](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=27) (IV, xx, 3); the Son and He are the "two hands" by which [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) created [man](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7463) (IV, præf., n. 4; IV, xx, 20; V, vi, 1). Considered with regard to the Church, the same [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) is truth, grace, a pledge of immortality, a principle of union with [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ; intimately united to the Church, He gives the [sacraments](https://www.catholic.org/prayers/sacrament.php) their efficacy and [virtue](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12106) (III, xvii, 2, xxiv, 1; IV, xxxiii, 7; V, viii, 1).

St. Hippolytus, though he does not speak at all clearly of the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) regarded as a distinct person, supposes him, however, to be God, as well as the Father and the Son (Contra Noët., viii, xii, in P.G., X, 816, 820).

Tertullian is one of the writers of this age whose tendency to Subordinationism is most apparent, and that in spite of his being the author of the definitive formula: "Three persons, one [substance](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11137) ". And yet his teaching on the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is in every way remarkable. He seems to have been the first among the Fathers to affirm His Divinity in a clear and absolutely precise manner. In his work "Adversus Praxean" lie dwells at length on the greatness of the Paraclete. The Holy Ghost, he says, is [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) (c. xiii in P.L., II, 193); of the [substance](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11137) of the Father (iii, iv in P.L., II, 181-2); one and the same [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) with the Father and the Son (ii in P.L., II, 180); proceeding from the Father through the Son (iv, viii in P.L., II, 182, 187); teaching all [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) (ii in P.L., II, 179).

St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, or at least the Ekthesis tes pisteos , which is commonly attributed to him, and which dates from the period 260-270, gives us this remarkable passage (P.G., X, 933 sqq.): "One is God, Father of the living Word, of the subsisting Wisdom. . . . One the Lord, one of one, [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) of God, invisible of invisible. . .One the Holy Ghost, having His subsistence from God. . . . Perfect Trinity, which in eternity, glory, and power, is neither divided, nor separated. . . . Unchanging and immutable Trinity."

In 304, the [martyr](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7650) [St. Vincent](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1992) said (Ruinart, op. cit., 325): "I confess the [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) Christ, Son of the Father most High, one of one; I recognize Him as one [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) with the Father and the Holy Ghost."

But we must come down towards the year 360 to find the doctrine on the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) explained both fully and clearly. It is St. Athanasius who does so in his "Letters to Serapion" (P.G., XXVI, col. 525 sq.). He had been informed that certain Christians held that the Third [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) of the Blessed Trinity was a creature. To refute them he questions the Scriptures, and they furnish him with arguments as solid as they are numerous. They tell him, in particular, that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is united to the Son by relations just like those existing between the Son and the Father; that He is sent by the Son; that He is His mouth-piece and glorifies Him; that, unlike creatures, He has not been made out of nothing, but comes forth from [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ; that He performs a sanctifying work among men, of which no creature is capable; that in possessing Him we possess [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ; that the Father created everything by Him; that, in fine, He is immutable, has the attributes of immensity, oneness, and has a [right](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10046) to all the appellations that are used to express the dignity of the Son. Most of these conclusions he supports by means of Scriptural texts, a few from amongst which are given above. But the writer lays special stress on what is read in [Matthew](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=47) 28:19. "The Lord", he writes (Ad Serap., III, n. 6, in P.G., XXVI, 633 sq.), "founded the [Faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) of the Church on the Trinity, when He said to His [Apostles](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=933) : 'Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' If the Holy Ghost were a creature, [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) would not have associated Him with the Father; He would have avoided making a heterogeneous Trinity, composed of unlike elements. What did [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) stand in need of? Did He need to join to Himself a being of different [nature](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8348) ? . . . No, the Trinity is not composed of the Creator and the creature."

A little later, St. Basil, Didymus of Alexandria, St. Epiphanius, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, St. Ambrose, and St. Gregory of [Nyssa](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8591) took up the same thesis ex professo , supporting it for the most part with the same proofs. All these writings had prepared the way for the Council of [Constantinople](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3297) which, in 381, condemned the Pneumatomachians and solemnly proclaimed the true doctrine. This teaching forms part of the [Creed](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3481) of Constantinople, as it is called, where the symbol refers to the Holy Ghost, "Who is also our [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and Who gives life; Who proceeds from the Father, Who is adored and glorified together with the Father and the Son; Who spoke by the prophets ". Was this creed, with these particular words, approved by the council of 381 ? Formerly that was the common opinion, and even in recent times it has been held by authorities like Hefele, Hergenröther, and Funk ; other historians, amongst whom are Harnack and Duchesne, are of the contrary opinion; but all agree in admitting that the [creed](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3481) of which we are speaking was received and approved by the Council of Chalcedon, in 451, and that, at least from that time, it became the official formula of [Catholic](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2678) orthodoxy.

### IV. PROCESSION OF THE HOLY GHOST

We need not dwell at length on the precise meaning of the Procession in God. (See T RINITY .) It [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) suffice here to remark that by this word we mean the relation of origin that exists between one Divine [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) and another, or between one and the two others as its principle of origin. The Son proceeds from the Father; the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds from the Father and the Son. The latter [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) be specially treated here.

A

That the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds from the Father has always been admitted by all Christians ; the [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) is expressly stated in John, xv, 26. But the Greeks, after Photius, deny that He proceeds from the Son. And yet such is manifestly the teaching of Holy [Scripture](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10624) and the Fathers.

(1) In the [New Testament](https://www.catholic.org/bible/new_testament.php)

(a) The [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is called the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) ( [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 8:9 ), the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of the Son ( [Galatians](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=55) 4:6 ), the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) ( [Acts](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=51) 16:7 ). These terms imply a relation of the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) to the Son, which can only be a relation of origin. This conclusion is so much the more indisputable as all admit the similar argument to explain why the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is called the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of the Father. Thus St. Augustine argues (In Joan., tr. xcix, 6, 7 in P.L., XXXV, 1888): "You hear the [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) himself declare: 'It is not you that speak, but the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of your Father that speaketh in you'. Likewise you hear the [Apostle](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=933) declare: ' [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) hath sent the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of His Son into your hearts. Could there then be two spirits, one the [spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of the Father, the other the [spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of the Son? Certainly not. Just as there is only one Father, just as there is only one [Lord](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) or one Son, so there is only one Spirit, Who is, consequently, the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of both. . . Why then should you refuse to believe that He proceeds also from the Son, since He is also the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of the Son? If He did not proceed from Him, Jesus, when He appeared to His disciples after His Resurrection, would not have breathed on them, saying: 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost'. What, indeed, does this breathing signify, but that the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) proceeds also from Him?" St. Athanasius had argued in exactly the same way (De Trinit. et Spir. S., n. 19, in P.G., XXVI, 1212), and concluded: "We say that the Son of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) is also the source of the Spirit."

(b) The [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) receives from the Son, according to [John](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=50) 16:13-15 : "When he, the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of truth, is come he [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you. He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you." Now, one Divine [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) can receive from another only by Procession, being related to that other as to a principle. What the [Paraclete](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8966) [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) receive from the Son is immanent knowledge, which He [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) afterwards manifest exteriorly. But this immanent [knowledge](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6682) is the very essence of the Holy Ghost. The latter, therefore, has His origin in the Son, the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds from the Son. "He shall not speak of Himself", says St. Augustine (In Joan., tr. xcix, 4, in P.L., XXXV, 1887), "because He is not from Himself, but He shall tell you all He shall have heard. He shall hear from him from whom He proceeds. In His case, to hear is to know, and to know is to be. He derives His [knowledge](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6682) from Him from Whom He derives His essence." St. Cyril of [Alexandria](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=465) remarks that the words: "He shall receive of mine" signify "the [nature](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8348) " which the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) has from the Son, as the Son has His from the Father (De Trinit., dialog. vi, in P.G., LXXV, 1011). Besides, [Jesus](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) gives this [reason](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9875) of His assertion: "He shall receive of mine": "All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine Now, since the Father has with regard to the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) the relation we term Active Spiration, the Son has it also; and in the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) there exists, consequently, with regard to both, Passive Spiration or Procession.

(2) The same [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) has been constantly held by the Fathers

This fact is undisputed as far as the Western Fathers are concerned; but the Greeks deny it in the case of the Easterns. We [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) cite, therefore, a few witnesses from among the latter. The testimony of St. Athanasius has been quoted above, to the effect that "the Son is the source of the Spirit", and the statement of Cyril of [Alexandria](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=465) that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) has His "nature" from the Son. The latter saint further asserts (Thesaur., assert. xxxiv in P.G., LXXV, 585); "When the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) comes into our hearts, He makes us like to God, because He proceeds from the Father and the Son"; and again (Epist., xvii, Ad Nestorium, De excommunicatione in P.G., LXXVII, 117): "The [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is not unconnected with the Son, for He is called the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) of Truth, and [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) is the [Truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) ; so He proceeds from Him as well as from [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) the Father ." St. Basil (De Spirit. S., xviii, in P.G., XXXII, 147) wishes us not to depart from the traditional order in mentioning the Three Divine Persons, because "as the Son is to the Father, so is the [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) to the Son, in accordance with the ancient order of the names in the formula of [baptism](https://www.catholic.org/prayers/sacrament.php?id=1) ". St. [Epiphanius](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4322) writes (Ancor., viii, in P. G., XLIII, 29, 30) that the [Paraclete](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8966) "is not to be considered as unconnected with the Father and the Son, for He is with Them one in [substance](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11137) and divinity", and states that "He is from the Father and the Son"; a little further, he adds (op. cit., xi, in P.G., XLIII, 35): "No one knows the Spirit, besides the Father, except the Son, from Whom He proceeds and of Whom He receives." Lastly, a council held at Seleucia in 410 proclaims its [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) "in the Holy Living Spirit, the Holy Living Paraclete, Who proceeds from the Father and the Son" (Lamy, "Concilium Seleuciæ", Louvain, 1868).

However, when we compare the Latin writers, as a body, with the Eastern writers, we notice a difference in language: while the former almost unanimously affirm that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds from the Father and from the Son, the latter generally say that He proceeds from the Father through the Son. In reality the thought expressed by both Greeks and Latins is one and the same, only the manner of expressing it is slightly different: the Greek formula ek tou patros dia tou ouiou expresses directly the order according to which the Father and the Son are the principle of the Holy Ghost, and implies their equality as principle; the Latin formula expresses directly this equality, and implies the order. As the Son Himself proceeds from the Father, it is from the Father that He receives, with everything else, the [virtue](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12106) that makes Him the principle of the Holy Ghost. Thus, the Father alone is principium absque principio, aitia anarchos prokatarktike, and, comparatively, the Son is an intermediate principle. The distinct use of the two prepositions, ek (from) and dia (through), implies nothing else. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Greek theologians Blemmidus, Beccus, Calecas, and Bessarion called attention to this, explaining that the two particles have the same signification, but that from is better suited to the First Person, Who is the source of the others, and through to the Second Person, Who comes from the Father. Long before their [time](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11571) St. Basil had written (De Spir. S., viii, 21, in P.G., XXXII, 106): "The expression di ou expresses acknowledgment of the primordial principle \[ tes prokatarktikes aitias \]"; and St. Chrysostom (Hom. v in Joan., n. 2, in P.G., LIX, 56): "If it be said through Him, it is said solely in order that no one may imagine that the Son is not generated": It may be added that the terminology used by the Eastern and Western writers, respectively, to express the [idea](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6024) is far from being invariable. Just as Cyril, Epiphanius, and other Greeks affirm the Procession ex utroque, so several Latin writers did not consider they were departing from the teaching of their Church in expressing themselves like the Greeks. Thus [Tertullian](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11392) (Contra Prax., iv, in P.L., II, 182): "Spiritum non aliunde puto quam a Patre per Filium"; and St. Hilary (De Trinit., lib., XII, n. 57, in P.L., X, 472), addressing himself to the Father, protests that he wishes to adore, with Him and the Son "Thy Holy Spirit, Who comes from Thee through thy only Son". And yet the same writer had said, a little higher (op. cit., lib. II, 29, in P.L., X, 69), "that we must confess the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) coming from the Father and the Son", a clear [proof](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9667) that the two formulæ were regarded as substantially equivalent.

B

Proceeding both from the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost, nevertheless, proceeds from Them as from a single principle. This [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) is, at the very least insinuated in the passage of John, xvi, 15 (cited above), where [Christ](https://www.catholic.org/clife/jesus) establishes a necessary connection between His own sharing in all the Father has and the Procession of the Holy Ghost. Hence it follows, indeed, that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds from the two other Persons, not in so far as They are distinct, but inasmuch as Their Divine perfection is numerically one. Besides, such is the explicit teaching of ecclesiastical tradition, which is concisely put by St. Augustine (De Trin., lib. V, c. xiv, in P.L., XLII, 921): "As the Father and the Son are only one [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and, relatively to the creature, only one Creator and one Lord, so, relatively to the Holy Ghost, They are only one principle." This doctrine was defined in the following words by the Second [Ecumenical Council](https://www.catholic.org/prayers/councils.php) of Lyons \[ Denzinger, "Enchiridion" (1908), n. 460\]: "We confess that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but as from one principle, not by two spirations, but by one single spiration." The teaching was again laid down by the Council of [Florence](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4739) (ibid., n. 691), and by [Eugene IV](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=969) in his Bull "Cantate Domino" (ibid., n. 703 sq.).

C

It is likewise an article of [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) that the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) does not proceed, like the Second [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) of the Trinity, by way of generation. Not only is the Second [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) alone called Son in the Scriptures, not only is He alone said to be begotten, but He is also called the only Son of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) ; the ancient symbol that bears the name of Saint Athanasius states expressly that "the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) comes from the Father and from the Son not made not created, not generated, but proceeding". As we are utterly incapable of otherwise fixing the meaning of the mysterious mode affecting this relation of origin, we apply to it the name spiration, the signification of which is principally negative and by way of contrast, in the sense that it affirms a Procession peculiar to the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) and exclusive of filiation. But though we distinguish absolutely and essentially between [generation](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5044) and spiration, it is a very delicate and difficult task to say what the difference is. [St. Thomas](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=410) (I, Q. xxvii), following St. Augustine (Do Trin., XV, xxvii), finds the explanation and, as it the were, the epitome, of the doctrine in principle that, in God, the Son proceeds through the [Intellect](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6143) and the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) through the Will. The Son is, in the language of Scripture, the image of the Invisible God, His Word, His uncreated wisdom. [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) contemplates Himself and knows Himself from all eternity, and, knowing Himself, He forms within Himself a substantial [idea](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6024) of Himself, and this substantial thought is His Word. Now every act of [knowledge](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6682) is accomplished by the production in the [intellect](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6143) of a representation of the object known; from this head, then the process offers a certain [analogy](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=696) with generation, which is the production by a living being of a being partaking of the same [nature](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8348) ; and the [analogy](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=696) is only so much the more striking when there is question of this act of Divine knowledge, the eternal term of which is a substantial being, consubstantial within the knowing subject. As to the Holy Ghost, according to the common doctrine of theologians, He proceeds through the will. The Holy Spirit, as His name indicates, is Holy in [virtue](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12106) of His origin, His spiration ; He comes therefore from a holy principle; now [holiness](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5813) resides in the will, as [wisdom](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=27) is in the intellect. That is also the [reason](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9875) why He is so often called par excellence, in the writings of the Fathers, Love and Charity. The Father and the Son love one another from all eternity, with a perfect ineffable love ; the term of this infinite fruitful mutual love is Their [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) Who is co-eternal and con-substantial with Them. Only, the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) is not indebted to the manner of His Procession precisely for this perfect resemblance to His principle, in other words for His consubstantiality ; for to [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) or love an object does not formally imply the production of its immanent image in the [soul](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10963) that loves, but rather a tendency, a movement of the [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) towards the thing loved, to be united to it and enjoy it. So, making every allowance for the feebleness of our intellects in knowing, and the unsuitability of our words for expressing the mysteries of the Divine life, if we can grasp how the word generation, freed from all the imperfections of the material order may be applied by [analogy](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=696) to the Procession of the Word, so we may see that the term can in no way befittingly applied to the Procession of the Holy Ghost.

### V. FILIOQUE

Having treated of the part taken by the Son in the Procession of the Holy Ghost, we come next to consider the introduction of the expression [Filioque](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4673) into the [Creed](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3481) of Constantinople. The author of the addition is unknown, but the first trace of it is found in Spain. The [Filioque](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4673) was successively introduced into the Symbol of the Council of Toledo in 447, then, in pursuance of an order of another [synod](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11213) held in the same place (589), it was inserted in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. Admitted likewise into the Symbol Quicumque , it began to appear in [France](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4817) in the eighth century. It was chanted in 767, in Charlemagne's [chapel](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2799) at Gentilly, where it was heard by ambassadors from Constantine Copronymnus. The Greeks were astonished and protested, explanations were given by the Latins, and many discussions followed. The [Archbishop](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1015) of Aquileia, Paulinus, defended the addition at the Council of Friuli, in 796. It was afterwards accepted by a council held at Aachen, in 809. However, as it proved a stumbling-block to the Greeks Pope [Leo III](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1003) disapproved of it; and, though he entirely agreed with the Franks on the question of the doctrine, he advised them to omit the new word. He himself caused two large silver tablets, on which the [creed](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3481) with the disputed expression omitted was engraved to be erected in St. Peter's . His advice was unheeded by the Franks ; and, as the conduct and [schism](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10569) of Photius seemed to justify the Westerns in paying no more regard to the feelings of the Greeks, the addition of the words was accepted by the Roman Church under [Benedict VIII](https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=930) (cf. Funk, "Kirchengeschichte", Paderborn, 1902, p. 243).

The Greeks have always blamed the Latins for making the addition. They considered that, quite apart from the question of doctrine involved by the expression, the insertion was made in violation of a [decree](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3710) of the Council of Ephesus, forbidding anyone "to produce, write, or compose a [confession](https://www.catholic.org/prayers/confession.php) of [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicæa". Such a [reason](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9875) [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) not bear examination. Supposing the [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) of the [dogma](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3937) (established above), it is inadmissible that the Church could or would have deprived herself of the [right](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10046) to mention it in the symbol. If the opinion be adhered to, and it has strong arguments to support it, which considers that the developments of the [Creed](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3481) in what concerns the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) were approved by the Council of [Constantinople](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3297) (381) , at once it might be laid down that the [bishops](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=1918) at [Ephesus](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4310) (431) certainly did not think of condemning or blaming those of Constantinople. But, from the fact that the disputed expression was authorized by the Council of Chalcedon, in 451, we conclude that the prohibition of the Council of [Ephesus](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4310) was never understood, and ought not to be understood, in an absolute sense. It may be considered either as a doctrinal, or as a merely disciplinary pronouncement. In the first case it would exclude any addition or modification opposed to, or at variance with, the deposit of Revelation; and such seems to be its historic import, for it was proposed and accepted by the Fathers to oppose a formula tainted with Nestorianism. In the second case considered as a disciplinary measure, it can bind only those who are not the depositaries of the supreme power in the Church. The latter, as it is their [duty](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4101) to teach the revealed [truth](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11728) and to preserve it from error, possess, by Divine authority, the power and [right](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10046) to draw up and propose to the faithful such confessions of [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) as circumstances may demand. This [right](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10046) is as unconfinable as it is inalienable.

### VI. GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST

This title and the theory connected with it, like the theory of the fruits of the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) and that of the sins against the Holy Ghost, imply what theologians call [appropriation](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=969) . By this term is meant attributing especially to one Divine [Person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) perfections and exterior works which seem to us more clearly or more immediately to be connected with Him, when we consider His personal characteristics, but which in reality are common to the Three Persons. It is in this sense that we attribute to the Father the perfection of omnipotence, with its most striking manifestations, e.g. the Creation, because He is the principle of the two other Persons; to the Son we attribute [wisdom](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=27) and the works of wisdom, because He proceeds from the Father by the [Intellect](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6143) ; to the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) we attribute the operations of [grace](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5305) and the sanctification of souls, and in particular spiritual [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) and fruits , because He proceeds from the Father and the Son as Their mutual love and is called in Holy Writ the goodness and the charity of God.

The [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) of the [Holy Ghost](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5833) are of two kinds: the first are specially intended for the sanctification of the [person](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9193) who receives them; the second, more properly called [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) , are extraordinary favours granted for the help of another, favours, too, which do not sanctify by themselves, and may even be separated from sanctifying grace. Those of the first class are accounted seven in number, as enumerated by [Isaias](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6193) (11:2-3), where the [prophet](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9674) sees and describes them in the Messias. They are the [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) of wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety (godliness), and fear of the Lord.

>  The gift of wisdom, by detaching us from the world, makes us relish and love only the things of heaven.
>   The gift of understanding helps us to grasp the truths of [religion](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9935) as far as is necessary.
>   The gift of counsel springs from [supernatural](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11159) prudence, and enables us to see and choose correctly what [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) help most to the [glory](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5201) of [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) and our own salvation.
>    By the gift of [fortitude](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4792) we receive courage to overcome the obstacles and difficulties that arise in the practice of our religious duties.
>    The gift of [knowledge](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6682) points out to us the path to follow and the dangers to avoid in order to reach heaven.
>    The gift of piety, by inspiring us with a tender and filial confidence in God, makes us joyfully embrace all that pertains to His service.
>    Lastly, the gift of fear fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and makes us dread, above all things, to offend Him.

As to the inner [nature](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8348) of these gifts, theologians consider them to be [supernatural](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11159) and permanent qualities, which make us attentive to the voice of God, which render us susceptible to the workings of actual grace, which make us love the things of God, and, consequently, render us more obedient and docile to the inspirations of the Holy Ghost.

But how do they differ from the virtues ? Some writers think they are not really distinct from them, that they are the virtues inasmuch as the latter are free [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) of God, and that they are identified essentially with grace, charity, and the virtues. That opinion has the particular [merit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=7909) of avoiding a multiplication of the entities infused into the soul. Other writers look upon the [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) as perfections of a higher order than the virtues ; the latter, they say, dispose us to follow the impulse and guidance of [reason](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=9875) ; the former are functionally intended to render the [will](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=12332) obedient and docile to the inspirations of the Holy Ghost. For the former opinion, see Bellevüe, "L'uvre du Saint-Esprit" (Paris, 1902), 99 sq.; and for the latter, see St. Thomas, I-II, Q. lxviii, a. 1, and Froget, "De l'habitation du Saint-Esprit dans les âmes justes" (Paris, 1900), 378 sq.

The [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) of the second class, or charismata, are known to us partly from St. Paul, and partly from the history of the primitive Church, in the bosom of which [God](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5217) plentifully bestowed them. Of these "manifestations of the Spirit", "all these things \[that\] one and the same [Spirit](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=11004) worketh, dividing to every one according as he will", the [Apostle](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=933) speaks to us, particularly in I Corinthians 12:6-11; I Corinthians 12:28-31; and [Romans](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=52) 12:6-8.

In the first of these three passages we find nine [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) mentioned: the gift of speaking with wisdom, the gift of speaking with knowledge, faith, the [grace](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=5305) of healing, the gift of miracles, the gift of prophecy, the gift of discerning spirits, the gift of tongues, the gift of interpreting speeches. To this list we must at least add, as being found in the other two passages indicated, the gift of government, the gift of helps, and perhaps what Paul calls distributio and misericordia . However, exegetes are not all agreed as to the number of the charismata, or the [nature](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=8348) of each one of them; long ago, St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine had pointed out the obscurity of the question. Adhering to the most probable views on the subject, we may at once classify the [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) and explain the meaning of most of them as follows. They [form](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4781) four natural groups:

-   Two [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) which regard the teaching of Divine things: sermo sapientiæ, sermo scientiæ, the former relating to the exposition of the higher mysteries, the latter to the body of [Christian](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2927) truths.
-   Three [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) that lend support to this teaching: fides, gratia sanitatum, operatio virtutum. The [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) here spoken of is [faith](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4554) in the sense used by [Matthew](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=47) 17:19: that which works wonders; so it is, as it were, a [condition](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3239) and a part of the two [gifts](https://www.catholic.org/shopping/?category=10) mentioned with it.
-   Four [charismata](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2814) that served to edify, exhort, and encourage the faithful, and to confound the unbelievers: prophetia, discretio spirituum, genera linguarum, interpretatio sermonum. These four seem to fall logically into two groups; for prophecy, which is essentially inspired pronouncement on different religious subjects, the declaration of the future being only of secondary import, finds its complement and, as it were, its check i
