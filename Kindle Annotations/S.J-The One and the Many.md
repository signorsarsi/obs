## Highlights
The problem can be summed up thus: How is it possible for many distinct individual beings to share the same specific mode of being or essence, to belong to the same species? What are the ultimate conditions of possibility that can render intelligible these two opposite attributes in the same being? — location: [1734](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1734) ^ref-17780

Step 1. Wherever there are many beings belonging to the same species or kind of being, each member of this species is at once like every other, because it has the same specific nature or essence, and yet unlike or distinct from every other, because it is this individual being and not that other one in the same species. Neither the likeness nor the unlikeness, the sameness nor the difference, can be denied without destroying the very data of the problem with which we began. — location: [1761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1761) ^ref-34126

---
Therefore, there must be, within the essence or nature of every member of a species, a real metaphysical composition of two really distinct but correlative co-principles: one to ground the similarity of a common specific essence; the other to ground the distinctness of one individual member from another. — location: [1769](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1769) ^ref-54103

---
As we saw in the case of the essence/existence composition, these two distinct principles cannot be things, or complete beings, because this would destroy the unity of each being that we started off with. Hence they must be metaphysical co-principles, distinct but correlative and inseparable. One can’t be without the other. — location: [1772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1772) ^ref-64437

Step. 3. How to identify and describe these two principles? Let us describe them by their functions, the role they play: — location: [1774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1774) ^ref-8087

1. The Principle of similarity: — location: [1775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1775) ^ref-48199

It is not the outer visible form, but the inner intelligible “shape” or constitutive structure of the essence (i.e., the mode of existence which receives the act of existence according to the capacity of its essence). — location: [1779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1779) ^ref-61857

---
The Principle of distinction. This is the difficult part of the analysis, to find a principle that will distinguish one individual in the species from another, without introducing any essential qualitative difference between them. For this would immediately change the species from the same or qualitatively equal mode of being to another higher or lower one, which would destroy the original data to be explained. Let us proceed by the progressive elimination of solutions that cannot work. — location: [1783](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1783) ^ref-1086

It cannot be another essential form or formal qualitative principle in the essential order. For then (1) this would introduce a new qualitative formal note different in each member, which would automatically turn it into another species or kind of being. There is no use appealing here to different accidental or non-essential properties. For these presuppose that we already have two distinct individuals set up to receive these different accidental properties. Thus two human beings cannot be essentially distinguished by one having red hair and the other black, for to have two different colors of hair presupposes that they already have two distinct bodies and two heads. How are we going to distinguish the two basic subjects who can possess the distinct sets of further attributes? — location: [1787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1787) ^ref-40353

---
B. Hence we must adopt the only other alternative: the principle of distinction must be a non-formal or non-qualitative one which is able to distinguish two natures without introducing formal qualitative differentiation between them. Since such a principle is the correlative opposite of form—a qualitative notion—Aristotle first called it matter, or primary matter. How can this do the job of distinguishing without formal differentiation? — location: [1799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1799) ^ref-49402

---
This is just what we need to do the job at hand. The identical form, or formal structure, intelligible pattern, can now be reproduced endlessly in different parts of this extended matter, qualitatively unchanged: each new reproduction is distinct from every other precisely because it is here and not there in the space-time matrix of extended matter. — location: [1805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01D4TAXS2&location=1805) ^ref-56994
