## Highlights
The behaviours of complex systems Complex systems exhibit several kinds of telltale behaviour. I will describe some of these behaviours briefly here; they will be examined in more detail in later chapters. •   self-organization into patterns, as occurs with flocks of birds or schools of fish — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00L4CK0M6&location=541) ^ref-49285

•   chaotic behaviour where small changes in initial conditions (‘the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in Argentina’) produce large later changes (‘a hurricane in the Caribbean’) •   ‘fat-tailed’ behaviour, where rare events (e.g. mass extinctions and market crashes) occur much more often than would be predicted by a normal (bell-curve) distribution •   adaptive interaction, where interacting agents (as in markets or the Prisoner’s Dilemma) modify their strategies in diverse ways as experience accumulates. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00L4CK0M6&location=546) ^ref-54759
