## Highlights
What distinguishes the left from the liberal is the view that, along with political rights that guarantee freedoms to speak, worship, travel, and vote as we choose, we also have claims to social rights, which undergird the real exercise of political rights. Liberal writers call them benefits, entitlements, or safety nets. — location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=146) ^ref-3101

justice. But these, and other social rights to cultural life, are codified in the United Nation’s 1948 “Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” While most member states ratified it, no state has yet created a society that assures those rights, and the Declaration has no legal force. In 530 languages it is the world’s most translated document, but the Declaration remains aspirational. To stand on the left is to insist that those aspirations are not utopian. — location: [149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=149) ^ref-15538

What concerns me most here are the ways in which contemporary voices considered to be leftist have abandoned the philosophical ideas that are central to any left-wing standpoint: a commitment to universalism over tribalism, a firm distinction between justice and power, and a belief in the possibility of progress. All these ideas are connected. — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=160) ^ref-44843

Woke demands that nations and peoples face up to their criminal histories. In the process it often concludes that all history is criminal. Some critics of this book’s first edition found the definition above insufficient. They charged that without a more expansive definition and a list of examples, my critique lacked a target. The complaint was surprising, since examples of woke behavior are described almost daily in newspapers around the world. My aim was not to provide another list of them, but to understand the philosophical ideas buried in apparently harmless assumptions that undergird woke thinking. But, for those readers not yet tired of examples, here are three more, chosen from hundreds that display ways in which woke can be ridiculous as well as terrifying.11 A German publisher promoted a new book with the sentence: “This book will open your eyes.” She was immediately attacked for using words that might cause suffering to blind people, and forced to withdraw the ad. The young black poet Amanda Gorman became an international success after reading her poem “The Hill We Climb” at Joe Biden’s inauguration. Seventeen foreign publishers quickly bought the rights. For the Dutch edition, Gorman suggested a white, non-binary Dutch writer, whose Booker Prize-winning work she admired. That’s the only good reason for choosing a translator: I like your work, want to take a crack at mine? Then a black Dutch fashion blogger wrote an article saying that Gorman’s work should only be translated by a black woman. The white author withdrew, but the story reverberated across Europe. A Catalan translation had already been completed and paid for but, since the translator was a white man, a new one was hired. A black rapper was found to translate into Swedish but, due to a shortage of black translators, Denmark hired a brown woman who wears a hijab. The German publisher found a very German solution and hired an entire committee of female translators: a black, a brown, and a white one. However, as I write, the latest examples of woke behavior leave nothing to laugh about. For the postcolonial woke, Israel has long been located in the Global North, while Palestine belongs to the Global South. The folly of this bad-faith geography was revealed when many of the woke celebrated Hamas’s brutal massacre of over 1,200 Israeli citizens as “resistance to the Occupation” or even “poetic justice.” Justice it was not; many of the alleged occupiers had spent years working toward peace in ways that were direct and useful, such as bringing their Gazan neighbors to medical care. Others were three months old. But neither righteousness nor innocence made any difference. The victims belonged to the wrong tribe, and that was enough to murder them. Need I add that bombing thousands of children who belong to the other tribe is no less a war crime? In Evil in Modern Thought I argued that dividing evils into greater and lesser, and trying to weigh them, is not only hopeless but… — location: [331](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=331) ^ref-64845

It also implies that this recognition is an achievement: to see humanity in all the weird and beautiful ways it appears is a feat that demands you go beyond appearances. In this sense Foucault was right to say that the human is a recent invention. Like other products of the modern, it was not one he valued, and he expected it to disappear. “Our task,” he wrote, “is to emancipate ourselves from humanism” – which requires accepting the death of the human, as he prophesied in his early The Order of Things. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=513) ^ref-63482

It’s now an article of faith that universalism, like other Enlightenment ideas, is a sham that was invented to disguise Eurocentric views that supported colonialism.

Wengrow argue that the non-European interlocuters were real. Their arguments largely rest on a study of Lahontan’s Dialogue with a Huron, published at the dawn of the Enlightenment in 1703, an enormously successful book that inspired many imitations. The French writer’s book recounts a series of conversations with a Wendat thinker and statesman named Kandiaronk, over the course of years Lahontan spent in Canada becoming fluent in Algonquin and Wendat. Instead of assuming, as many had, that indigenous people were incapable of the sophisticated political arguments attributed to Kandiaronk, Graeber and Wengrow present evidence that the historical Kandiaronk was known for his brilliance and eloquence, and engaged in just the sort of debates with Europeans that Lahontan recorded. — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=671) ^ref-59303

For Europe, for ourselves, and for humanity, comrades, we must turn over a new leaf, we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new humanity.

The key to modern history, wrote Schmitt, is the European land-grab that took over the globe.

Schmitt attacked the Monroe Doctrine: framed as an opposition to European colonization of South America, it became a declaration that only the United States would determine what happens on the continent it considers its backyard. This justified critique didn’t deter him, when writing on international law, from using the Monroe Doctrine as precedent to justify expanding the Greater German Reich. — location: [1349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1349) ^ref-2031

Taking aggression for granted, sociobiologists sought to understand why animals ever cooperated, and in sexual selection and kin selection they thought they had answers.

By the late twentieth century, such statements no longer counted as explanatory, but required deconstruction revealing some form of self-interest as the real driving force. None of the thinkers who contributed to making this assumption seem natural has asked the historical question about their own premise: might that assumption itself be part of a conceptual framework constructed during the twentieth century? The supposition that any genuine explanation of human behavior must penetrate high-flown, idealistic descriptions to reach the self-interested wheels that turn us is itself a piece of ideology whose history has yet to be written. — location: [1556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1556) ^ref-49902

This Darwinian brand of cynicism doesn’t exactly fill a gaping cultural void. Already, various avante-garde academics – deconstructionist literary theorists and anthropologists, adherents of critical legal theories – are viewing human communication as “discourses of power.” Already many people believe that in human affairs all (or at least much) is artifice, a self-serving manipulation of image. — location: [1569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1569) ^ref-6024

Unfortunately, the model underlies so many views that this careful debunking often goes unnoticed. But, even without the help of science and scholarship, a little self-reflection could convince us that we do not always act as the reigning ideologies suggest. We care about asserting truth, not just maintaining power; we often act with regard for others, from interests that are not material interests; and our behavior is rarely guided by the impulse to reproduce as many copies of ourselves (or our images) as possible. There is, however, a prominent exception: Donald Trump. Unlike the rest of us, he permanently exhibits the combination of motives we are told are the true forces driving human behavior. Nor does he appear to understand any other. Though he recognizes that other people, aka losers, have norms, he has no idea of how norms work, moving people to override self-interest in order to honor them. In acting on the international stage like Richard Dawkins’ ruthless genes, he has attracted millions of followers, who say they admire his authenticity. — location: [1575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1575) ^ref-30716

Unfortunately, the model underlies so many views that this careful debunking often goes unnoticed. But, even without the help of science and scholarship, a little self-reflection could convince us that we do not always act as the reigning ideologies suggest. We care about asserting truth and acting fairly, not just maintaining power; we often act with regard for others, from interests that are not material interests; and our behavior is rarely guided by the impulse to reproduce as many copies of ourselves (or our images) as possible.

Trump’s incomprehension of the fact people sometimes sacrifice their lives aroused the rage of the military, who might otherwise have backed a coup on January 6, 2021. Trump’s inability to grasp the ethos on which their lives are staked insured they could not fully support him.)49 In acting on the international stage like Richard Dawkins’ ruthless genes, he has attracted millions of followers, who say they admire his authenticity. — location: [1914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1914) ^ref-4178

You think we make progress toward practices that are kinder, more liberating, more respectful of human dignity: all goals of the left? Take a look at the history of an institution or two. What looked like steps toward progress turn out to be more sinister forms of repression. All of them are ways in which the state extends its domination over our lives. Once you’ve seen how every step forward becomes a more subtle and powerful step toward total subjection, you’re likely to conclude that progress is illusory. How far Foucault believed this himself is an open question, but it’s certainly the view most have drawn from his work. — location: [1691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1691) ^ref-60413

So what, precisely, are we meant to do? The scornful scare-quotes around the words ‘for’ and ‘against’ suggest we should be ashamed to raise such a vulgar concern. You may look for an argument; what you’ll find is contempt. Foucault makes us feel that judging something as better or worse is intellectually crude. Only simple minds ask banal questions; sophisticated thinkers gave them up long ago. So, Foucault never actually claims that bringing back drawing-and-quartering would be better, though he does say that the object of eighteenth-century prison reform was not to punish less but to punish better. “From being an art of unbearable sensations punishment has become an economy of suspended rights.” What conclusion should the reader draw? — location: [1723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1723) ^ref-9202

This generous reading of Foucault would bring him close to Rousseau, who also criticized early Enlightenment accounts of progress. The self-taught provincial burst on the Paris scene in 1750 with a prize-winning essay, “Discourse on the Arts and Sciences,” which savaged standard liberal views of the time. Against those who assumed that arts and science paved a smooth road to progress, Rousseau argued that they often simply feed authors’ vanity while disguising oppressive power structures. The arts and sciences, he wrote, “weave garlands of flowers around the chains that bind us.” — location: [1774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BYGK9J24&location=1774) ^ref-33413

It’s very hard to speak common sense with men like Michel Foucault. One always gets the worst of it – if only because his structural visions are more aesthetically alluring than those of critical rationalism.

Perhaps the problem with recognizing progress lies in the concept of progress itself. By definition, progress is not whatever we have now. It isn’t something that has already been attained, but something that should be attained in the future – preferably tomorrow morning.
