## Highlights
At this juncture I want to reassert my main point about the posthuman as a convergence phenomenon rather than a single new paradigm. This means that it mobilizes the insights, resources and methods of both posthumanism (as critique of Eurocentric privilege) and post-anthropocentrism (as critique of species privilege). The upholding of a convergence, hence a double move, helps to resist any flat — location: [1504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1504) ^ref-44364

The point of a posthuman position is that it envisages the subject as transversal, trans-individual, trans-species, trans-sexes. In short, it is a subject in movement. This kind of subjectivity obviously includes non-human others, of both — location: [1524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1524) ^ref-16512

But we do remain human and all-too-human in the simultaneous realization that the loss of humanist unity does not set us on the path to extinction, but is the building block for the next phase of becoming-subjects-together. Mindful of the fact that the statement ‘we humans’ — location: [1535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1535) ^ref-5226

Thus, the loss of humanist unity is the starting point for alternative ways of becoming-subjects-together. — location: [1538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1538) ^ref-6932

The realization of our inextricable interconnection with both human and non-human others is the epistemological and ethical bonus we gain from the crisis, or rather the transition brought about by the posthuman convergence.

The process of becoming begins with the realization of the loss of a familiar notion of the ‘human’, which coincides with the awareness of the present posthuman conditions, but it moves on transversally towards the quest for alternative ways of becoming. These get actualized through new sets of relations posited across the posthuman time continuum, that is to say the on-going task of constructing what we will have been capable of becoming. But because ‘we’ are not one and the same, the patterns of becoming will necessarily differ. This means that ‘we’ may always already have been posthuman, or may yet become it, depending on our embedded perspective or point of entry in this time-frame. — location: [1543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1543) ^ref-1895

The answer is what ‘we’ are capable of becoming. The particular answer can only be a pragmatic one, bound to time and space. It is the praxis that aims at becoming a multitude of missing people. A multiple ‘we’ becoming-world-together amidst the painful contradictions of the Anthropocene, when the waves of world history – this time round – may be about to erase from the sandy shores of this planet the face of many other species. — location: [1551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1551) ^ref-44886

Nozione di umano nel pensiero postumanista

Contemporary posthuman research in the Humanities has proved equal to the task of dealing with such a qualitative shift of focus, as well as the quantitative growth of new – and sometimes weird – objects of enquiry. Significant advances have been made for instance by literary and cultural Darwinism (Beer 1983; Carroll 2004); eco-feminism and animal studies (Donovan and Adams 1996, 2007; Midgley 1996); and social and cultural studies of evolutionary theories (Haraway 1990, 2003). — location: [1617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1617) ^ref-62174

If we now are ‘humanimals’ or trans-corporeal human-animal compounds, then the Earth, its geological strata and geologic subjects (Yusoff 2015) and its cosmos have become a political arena (Alaimo 2010). — location: [1622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1622) ^ref-57788

As argued in the previous chapters, thinking in posthuman times is about increasing the capacity to take in the intensity of the world and take on its objectionable — location: [1645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1645) ^ref-41979

aspects. Thinking is about increasing our relational capacity, so as to enhance our power (potentia) for freedom and resistance. Posthuman thinking is post-identitarian and relational: it turns the self away from a focus on its own identity into a threshold of active becoming. — location: [1647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1647) ^ref-42933

Thinking is a gateway to the openness of zoe – the non-human life that does not bear a human name, let alone your own individual name. Thinking is the stuff of the world (Alaimo 2014). And by taking place in the world, it is accountable to multiple constituencies, not only the academic community. All the more so today, when knowledge is being produced across a broad range of social, corporate, activist, artistic and mediated locations, as well as in scientific, technological academic settings. Producing knowledge is just as much the stuff of the world. — location: [1660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1660) ^ref-12500

Unsurprisingly, different kinds of posthumanism have already emerged: theoretical (Badmington 2003); insurgent (Papadopoulos 2010); speculative (Sterling 2012; Roden 2014); cultural (Wolfe 2010; Herbrechter 2013); literary (Nayar 2013); trans-humanist (Bostrom 2014); meta-humanist (Ferrando 2013); and a-humanist (MacCormack 2014). — location: [1687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1687) ^ref-28446

In order to answer these questions, I will point out the different lines of connection that compose the ensemble ‘we’, which I participate in. For the sake of the current discussion, ‘we’ are situated, feminist-minded, anti-racist, post- and de-colonial thinkers and practitioners, who are trying to come to terms with the challenges of the posthuman convergence, while avoiding a universal posture or undue generalizations. Considering, moreover, the contiguity between posthuman knowledge production and cognitive capitalism, new questions need to be raised and clarified. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1780) ^ref-19489

La rivolta posumanista non sembra voglia  attaccare il pensiero cristiano, ma il  pensiero del liberalismo bianco e colonizzatore che certo ebbe nel cristianesimo una religione , ma non la considerò un base rofondo ma solo superficiale

Is the product of posthuman knowledge just the expression of the schizoid speed and accelerations of advanced capitalism? — location: [1787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1787) ^ref-43195

politics. An example of the latter, Williams and Srnicek (2014: 354) argue: ‘an accelerationist politics seeks to preserve the gains of late capitalism, while going further than its value system, governance structures and mass pathologies will allow’ — location: [1798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07VSWPGGZ&location=1798) ^ref-19371

Buona analisi; Comunque l'aspetto interessante che tutte le critiche al neoliberalismo, al cpaitgalismo etc è fatta da pensatori con endoxa liberals
