I now embrace the theory of prophecy which holds that prophetic voices of great clarity, and with a quality of insight equal to that of any age, are speaking cogently all of the time. — location: [56](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=56) ^ref-40363

Aspetto religioso. Concetrato di profetismo e messianismo nel Nuovo Mondo.

---
Some who have difficulty with this theory assert that their faith rests on one or more of the prophets of old having given the “word” for all time and that the contemporary ones do not speak to their condition as the older ones do. But if one really believes that the “word” has been given for all time, how can one be a seeker? — location: [66](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=66) ^ref-39071

Greenleaf was a quacker. the Revelation never ends!!

---
But if one is servant, either leader or follower, one is always searching, listening, expecting that a better wheel for these times is in the making. It may emerge any day. — location: [73](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=73) ^ref-46638

This is revitalizing! Because gives us the strength to do something worth for our journey.

1968

---
A new moral principle is emerging which holds that the only authority deserving one’s allegiance is that which is freely and knowingly granted by the led to the leader in response to, and in proportion to, the clearly evident servant stature of the leader. — location: [81](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=81) ^ref-45885

Moral Authority is gained from the servant-ship of the leader. Only if the leader is a father can be obeyed.

---
Rather, they will freely respond only to individuals who are chosen as leaders because they are proven and trusted as servants. — location: [83](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=83) ^ref-52330

Those were the days, my friend. But those days are gone.

---
I say this because so many, having made their awesome decision for autonomy and independence from tradition, and having taken their firm stand against injustice and hypocrisy, find it hard to convert themselves into affirmative builders of a better society. — location: [88](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=88) ^ref-58799

I believe he is referring to the young students in the movement in the universities in the sixties.

The danger, perhaps, is to hear the analyst too much and the artist too little. — location: [104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=104) ^ref-21389

Great!!

I believe rather that it is awakened, revived, nourished by millions of solitary individuals whose deeds and works every day negate frontiers and the crudest implications of history. — location: [114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=114) ^ref-35133

Very Good, old Camus!

I did not get the notion of the servant as leader from conscious logic. — location: [123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=123) ^ref-59356

My good society will have strong individualism amidst community. It will have elitism along with populism. I listen to the old and to the young and find myself baffled and heartened by both. — location: [128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=128) ^ref-1054

The servant-leader is servant first — location: [136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=136) ^ref-11378

Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. — location: [137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=137) ^ref-4823

He is sharply different from the person who is leader first, — location: [138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=138) ^ref-28720

---
The best test, and difficult to administer, is: do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? And, — location: [142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=142) ^ref-34086

The famous test to measure the good servant leader.

And it is always an hypothesis under a shadow of doubt. — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=148) ^ref-45078

High moral stake

The very essence of leadership, going out ahead to show the way, derives from more than usual openness to inspiration. — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=159) ^ref-65205

---
Why would anybody accept the leadership of another except that the other sees more clearly where it is best to go? — location: [160](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=160) ^ref-3361

The leader has to see beyond..." I've been to the mountain top" (MLKing

---
many who presume to lead do not see more clearly and, in defense of their inadequacy, they all the more strongly argue that the “system” must be preserved—a fatal error in this day of candor. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=161) ^ref-56473

---
As long as he is leading, he always has a goal. — location: [170](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=170) ^ref-52509

---
By clearly stating and restating the goal the leader gives certainty and purpose to others who may have difficulty in achieving it for themselves. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=172) ^ref-27034

The important of vision

---
Every achievement starts with a goal. But not just any goal and not just anybody stating it. — location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=176) ^ref-49398

---
Not much happens without a dream. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=180) ^ref-53829

---
And for something great to happen, there must be a great dream. Behind every great achievement is a dreamer of great dreams. Much more than a dreamer is required to bring it to reality; but the dream must be there first. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=180) ^ref-622

The dream  is the first necessary condition, not sufficient, but  necessary,

As usual, the anecdotic approach. Not good.

---
No miracles were wrought; but out of a sustained intentness of listening that was produced by this unusual decision, this able man learned and received the insights needed to set the right course. And he strengthened his team by so doing. — location: [186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=186) ^ref-51887

The recipe approach is not good.

---
Or, he will hear enough that he will get an intuitive insight that resolves it. — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=192) ^ref-64479

Maybe, but listening to people that do not have the dream or they have not the same vision may be wasting time. 

---
I have a bias about this which suggests that only a true natural servant automatically responds to any problem by listening first. — location: [192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=192) ^ref-60871

Maybe is a bias

Religion is behind the scenes

Nothing is meaningful until it is related to the hearer’s own experience. — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=206) ^ref-28398

This is the sad common experience, but in speech not in written language (excluding Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind !)

---
The only feasible way of dealing with this is to push a particular verbal line of attack as far as it can go, and then switch to another verbal level which we might abandon when we have to... Many people...insist on a single self-consistent verbal scheme into which they try to — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=214) ^ref-25881

It is part of the enigma of human nature that the “typical” person—immature, stumbling, inept, lazy—is capable of great dedication and heroism if he is wisely led. — location: [254](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B008K5IPB8&location=254) ^ref-12861
