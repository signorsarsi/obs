## Highlights
The Other of Climate Change is a book about racial futurism. Racial futurism is a form of racial rule which stakes a claim on the future by constructing the racial other as that which could materialise if efforts are not taken in the present to pre-empt that future. Unlike prevailing theories of racialisation, which tend to construct the racial other in the idiom of different-from, the racial idiom at stake in racial futurism is that of the yet-to-come. Racial futurism is by necessity a reactive logic, yet one that masquerades in the language of progressive liberalism. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=292) ^ref-45948

the figure of the climate migrant or climate refugee occupies an important yet enigmatic position within the discursive order of climate change. Often referred to as the “human face” of climate change, the figure of the climate migrant or climate refugee has come to signify the social dislocations resulting from the geophysical impacts of climate change. — location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=304) ^ref-59503

Other great narration

Dipesh Chakrabarty positions humanism at the centre of the discussion about climate change.11 His primary concern is that climate change is putting human self-understanding to the test. Whereas the Enlightenment figure of the human was imagined as the agent of world history, capable of transforming the world through the arts, science and philosophy, Chakrabarty’s concern is that climate change poses a fundamental challenge to this image of the human. “In becoming a geophysical force on the planet,” he writes, “we have also developed a form of collective existence that has no ontological dimension. — location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=358) ^ref-51217

---
With climate change the human must now be rethought simultaneously as the subject of modernity and as a geological force capable of undermining the very ecological conditions that make modern human life possible. — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=366) ^ref-3684

Uomo come forza biologica

Jean Paul Sartre was unequivocal about this in his preface to Frantz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth, when he states that “there is nothing more consistent than a racist humanism, since the European has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters.” — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=380) ^ref-5266

---
Whether the migrant other of climate change is said to be the object target of humanitarianism, militarism or climate change adaptation policy, in each of these political discourses, the migrant other functions to stabilise the white Euro-western subject. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=390) ^ref-41504

the prevailing international political discourse on climate change migration is primarily one about rescuing whiteness from the climate crisis. — location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=400) ^ref-24761

---
For surely the dislocations that anthropogenic climate change is bound to inflict on much of the world’s population provides one of the strongest justifications for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Is it not the case that those in the industrialised North have a moral responsibility towards those in the Global South who will be made worse off by climate change while having contributed to it the very least? — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=401) ^ref-50835

i) il razzismo è dare alla natura (il colore della pelle) la differenza che è invece dovuta al potere del dominio del bianco e al capitalismo ii)i movimenti migratori inflitti alle popolazioni per il cambio di clima giustificano la riduzione del gas causa dell'effetto serra iii)Si nasconde dietro a questo che c'è una responsabilitò morale deio paesi causa dell'effetto serra, ossi il nord del mondo che colpisce il sud del mondo che avrà le conseguenze più dure dal riscaldamento globale mentre ha influto molto poco sullo stesso iv) quindi il fenomeno migratorio dell'apocalisse futuro diviene solo un meccanismo per proteggere i paesi inquinanti (e anche gli inquinati) senza responsabilità morali per il bianco. Da ciò si deduce che : a) se non ci sono responsabilità pe ril bianco che è l'autore di tutto e del progresso, perchè egli è il mondo, i migranti sono una razza inferiore  che ci serve epr fermarci ma bverso cui non abbiamo responsabilità

crisis? Throughout this book, I take race to be an effect of white humanism. Race is a political technology white humanism must invent in order to naturalise Blackness outside the category of the human. — location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=430) ^ref-62117

---
As one of nature’s collateral concepts, race is the category racists use to naturalise social relations under capitalism.24 It legitimates uneven, violent constructions of difference by explaining these as a function of nature as opposed to social forces, such as history and capital, that structure the life chances and everyday decisions of those subject to racist violence. — location: [434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=434) ^ref-16587

---
This is why we should find the figure of the climate migrant/refugee so troubling; it translates all manner of peoples’ everyday vulnerabilities, emergencies and disasters historically produced through the violence of colonialism, enslavement, imperialism, patriarchy and racial capitalism into the language of nature. — location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=437) ^ref-24694

---
My argument is indebted to Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright’s compelling thesis Climate Leviathan.26 These authors make the case that comprehending capitalism in relation to climate change means attending to the “adaptation of the political.”27 — location: [447](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=447) ^ref-7624

At the heart of the epistemic disjuncture of climate change and migration is the assumption that climate change causes migration. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=587) ^ref-18236

Nor is it the basis on which to construct a radical politics of climate change. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=590) ^ref-29647

that “the dynamics of the interaction of mobility with climate change are multifaceted and direct causation is difficult to establish.”50 — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=591) ^ref-28993

---
Thus, it is widely acknowledged in migration studies, and paradoxically even in the field of environmental migration itself, that migration is complex, the result of a range of political and economic circumstances, never just the “environment,” “climate” or “nature.” — location: [594](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=594) ^ref-14376

---
To suggest, then, that climate change supersedes the myriad other reasons for which people migrate—insecure land tenure, exploitative or non-existent labour markets, genealogies of violence, for instance—is therefore misleading, tantamount to what is now sometimes referred to as neo-environmental determinism or climate reductionism. — location: [596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=596) ^ref-15791

---
Yet, perhaps not surprisingly, this is precisely what is implied in much of the knowledge produced about the relation between climate change‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ and migration: climate change is always elevated as the primary driver, or trigger, of migration, even while it is said to be just one of the many migration drivers. — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=599) ^ref-23599

Calum Nicholson to call this as an “equivocal’ relation,” — location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=604) ^ref-37150

---
Nicholson means is that knowledge of the relationship between migration and climate change remains insufficient for intervening ethically in the relation itself. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=606) ^ref-41263

---
quandary. This is because any attempt to explain migration as a function of climate change will always end up subordinating historical explanation. — location: [620](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=620) ^ref-37969

---
A vivid example of this occurs in relation to the claim that the Syrian civil war is the result of climate change. In one notable study, it is argued that the war was the indirect result of a climate change–induced drought which drove large-scale rural to urban internal migration and which in turn led to the civil uprisings and eventually war.55 — location: [623](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=623) ^ref-3008

war. It is not difficult to see why powerful institutions, such as Western militaries, international organisations or national governments, with an interest in upholding capitalist political economy will mobilise climate change to explain what are inherently contestable and historical phenomena. — location: [632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=632) ^ref-23195

---
The Other of Climate Change, thus, challenges one of the foundational tenets of the academic field of environmental migration research, that the environment, including climate change, can explain migration. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=636) ^ref-3169

Climate change is, of course, a real material phenomenon. But it is not a crisis of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, automobility or consumptive desire. These are merely manifestations of racial capitalism’s perpetual violence. — location: [641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=641) ^ref-12411

---
Gregory White, who writes that “the evidence is abundant: a combination of rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns will likely affect migration patterns in the decades to come.”62 White is, of course, not incorrect in making this claim. It is entirely reasonable to assume that climate change will likely generate a range of effects, including migration. But there is also abundant evidence that numerous other phenomena will also likely affect migration in the decades to come. Shifting patterns of economic development will place new demands on labour migration. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BG3MQV4V&location=663) ^ref-40258
