## Highlights
Not only Hegel’s hope that reason would shape and control reality, but Marx’s hope that reason would be embodied in a revolutionary class and rational socialist society, had come to naught. The proletariat was not the “absolute negation of capitalist society presupposed by Marx,” and the contradictions of capitalism were not as explosive as Marx had forecast. — location: [223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=223) ^ref-54312

---
Marcuse took over the term “organized capitalism” developed by the Austro-Marxist Rudolf Hilferding to describe the administrative-bureaucratic apparatus which organizes, — location: [225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=225) ^ref-5006

---
Economic planning in the state, automatization in the economy, the rationalization of culture in the mass media, and the increased bureaucratization of all modes of social, political, and economic life had created a “totally administered society” that was resulting in “the decline of the individual.” — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=228) ^ref-37425

---
In this technological world, Marcuse claims that metaphysics is superseded by technology, in that the previous metaphysical concept of subjectivity, which postulates an active subject confronting a controllable world of objects, is replaced by a one-dimensional technical world where “pure instrumentality” and “efficacy” of arranging means and ends within a pre-established universe is the “common principle of thought and action.” — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=235) ^ref-34915

---
There are two ways to read Marcuse’s theory of the one-dimensional technical world and society, which is the primary focus of One-Dimensional Man. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=242) ^ref-11196

---
Thus, I would propose interpreting “one-dimensional” as conforming to existing thought and behavior and lacking a critical dimension and a dimension of potentialities that transcend the existing society. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=255) ^ref-58136

---
In Marcuse’s usage the adjective “one-dimensional” describes practices that conform to pre-existing structures, norms, and behavior, in contrast to multidimensional discourse, which focuses on possibilities that transcend the established state of affairs. — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=256) ^ref-23675

---
In the one-dimensional society, the subject is assimilated into the object and follows the dictates of external, objective norms and structures, thus losing the ability to discover more liberating possibilities and to engage in transformative practice to realize them. Marcuse’s theory presupposes the existence of a human subject with freedom, creativity, and self-determination who stands in opposition to an object-world, perceived as substance, which contains possibilities to be realized and secondary qualities like values, aesthetic traits, and aspirations, which can be cultivated to enhance human life. — location: [260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=260) ^ref-33920

---
In Marcuse’s view, the price that one-dimensional man pays for satisfaction is to surrender freedom and individuality. One-dimensional man does not know its true needs because its needs are not its own—they are administered, superimposed, and heteronomous; it is not able to resist domination, nor to act autonomously, for it identifies with public behavior and imitates and submits to the powers that be. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=267) ^ref-57058

---
Marcuse is thus a radical individualist who is deeply disturbed by the decline of the traits of authentic individuality that he so highly values. — location: [270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=270) ^ref-50716

He maintains that the society’s prosperity and growth are based on waste and destruction, its progress fueled by exploitation and repression, while its freedom and democracy are based on manipulation. — location: [299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=299) ^ref-6589

---
“this society is irrational as a whole. Its productivity is destructive of the free development of human needs and faculties … its growth dependent on the repression of the real possibilities for pacifying the struggle for existence—individual, national and international” (One-Dimensional Man, pp. ix–x). — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=303) ^ref-31775

---
“The union of growing productivity and growing destruction; the brinkmanship of annihilation; the surrender of thought, hope, and fear to the decisions of the powers that be; the preservation of misery in the face of unprecedented wealth constitute the most impartial indictment.… [Society’s] sweeping rationality, which propels efficiency and growth is itself irrational” (One-Dimensional Man, p. xiii). — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=328) ^ref-43133

Certainly, from the 1980s to the present, conservative trends have been dominant. Yet to present an adequate model for contemporary social theory and politics, forms of both domination and resistance should be analyzed. — location: [362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=362) ^ref-39683

If we attempt to relate the causes of the danger to the way in which society is organized and organizes its members, we are immediately confronted with the fact that advanced industrial society becomes richer, bigger, and better as it perpetuates the danger.

The political needs of society become individual needs and aspirations, their satisfaction promotes business and the commonweal, and the whole appears to be the very embodiment of Reason. — location: [483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=483) ^ref-27124

And yet this society is irrational as a whole. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=485) ^ref-47072

---
Our society distinguishes itself by conquering the centrifugal social forces with Technology rather than Terror, on the dual basis of an overwhelming efficiency and an increasing standard of living. — location: [490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=490) ^ref-30125

the judgment that human life is worth living, or rather can be and ought to be made worth living. — location: [498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=498) ^ref-11287

---
This judgment underlies all intellectual effort; it is the a priori of social theory, and its rejection (which is perfectly logical) rejects theory itself; — location: [499](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=499) ^ref-30077

the judgment that, in a given society, specific possibilities exist for the amelioration of human life and specific ways and means of realizing these possibilities. — location: [500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=500) ^ref-64814

---
Critical analysis has to demonstrate the objective validity of these judgments, and the demonstration has to proceed on empirical grounds. The established society has available an ascertainable quantity and quality of intellectual and material resources. How can these resources be used for the optimal development and satisfaction of individual needs and faculties with a minimum of toil and misery? — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=501) ^ref-3891

which appear to reconcile the forces opposing the system and to defeat or refute all protest in the name of the historical prospects of freedom from toil and domination. — location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=517) ^ref-37320

its sweeping rationality, which propels efficiency and growth, is itself irrational. — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=538) ^ref-4570

---
The fact that the vast majority of the population accepts, and is made to accept, this society does not render it less irrational and less reprehensible. — location: [539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=539) ^ref-30568

---
The distinction between true and false consciousness, real and immediate interest still is meaningful. But this distinction itself must be validated. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=540) ^ref-54830

---
Confronted with the total character of the achievements of advanced industrial society, critical theory is left without the rationale for transcending this society. — location: [545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=545) ^ref-22068

---
The vacuum empties the theoretical structure itself, because the categories of a critical social theory were developed during the period in which the need for refusal and subversion was embodied in the action of effective social forces. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=546) ^ref-64245

IL problema non  é una lotta tra forze dentro il sistema. ma il problema é il sistema stesso che tutto assorbe. Quesot fu il mantra del '68

---
The category “society” itself expressed the acute conflict between the social and political sphere—society as antagonistic to the state. Similarly, “individual,” “class,” “private,” “family” denoted spheres and forces not yet integrated with the established conditions—spheres of tension and contradiction. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=548) ^ref-22316

---
Modern industrial society is the pervasive identity of these opposites—it is the whole that is in question. At the same time, the position of theory cannot be one of mere speculation. It must be a historical position in the sense that it must be grounded on the capabilities of the given society. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=556) ^ref-20733

---
One-Dimensional Man will vacillate throughout between two contradictory hypotheses: (1) that advanced industrial society is capable of containing qualitative change for the foreseeable future; (2) that forces and tendencies — location: [559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=559) ^ref-57702

exist which may break this containment and explode the society. — location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=560) ^ref-22702

---
In this society, the productive apparatus tends to become totalitarian to the extent to which it determines not only the socially needed occupations, skills, and attitudes, but also individual needs and aspirations. — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=567) ^ref-45210

---
The totalitarian tendency of these controls seems to assert itself in still another sense—by spreading to the less developed and even to the pre-industrial areas of the world, and by creating similarities in the development of capitalism and communism. — location: [570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=570) ^ref-53240

Technology as such cannot be isolated from the use to which it is put; the technological society is a system of domination which operates already in the concept and construction of techniques. — location: [573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=573) ^ref-2698

---
As a technological universe, advanced industrial society is a political universe, the latest stage in the realization of a specific historical project—namely, the experience, transformation, and organization of nature as the mere stuff of domination. — location: [579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=579) ^ref-35397

---
Freedom of thought, speech, and conscience were—just as free enterprise, which they served to promote and protect—essentially critical ideas, designed to replace an obsolescent material and intellectual culture by a more productive and rational one. Once institutionalized, these rights and liberties shared the fate of the society of which they had become an integral part. The achievement cancels the premises. — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=614) ^ref-15815

---
Under the conditions of a rising standard of living, non-conformity with the system itself appears to be socially useless, and the more so when it entails tangible economic and political disadvantages and threatens the smooth operation of the whole. — location: [622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=622) ^ref-41440

---
Freedom of enterprise was from the beginning not altogether a blessing. As the liberty to work or to starve, it spelled toil, insecurity, and fear for the vast majority of the population. — location: [626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=626) ^ref-56552

---
If the individual were no longer compelled to prove himself on the market, as a free economic subject, the disappearance of this kind of freedom would be one of the greatest achievements of civilization. — location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=627) ^ref-5548

---
The very structure of human existence would be altered; the individual would be liberated from the work world’s imposing upon him alien needs and alien possibilities. The individual would be free to exert autonomy over a life that would be his own. If the productive apparatus could be organized and directed toward the satisfaction of the vital needs, its control might well be centralized; such control would not prevent individual autonomy, but render it possible. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=630) ^ref-13969

---
By virtue of the way it has organized its technological base, contemporary industrial society tends to be totalitarian. For “totalitarian” is not only a terroristic political coordination of society, but also a nonterroristic economic-technical coordination which operates through the manipulation of needs by vested interests. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=635) ^ref-60520

---
But the political trend may be reversed; essentially the power of the machine is only the stored-up and projected power of man. To the extent to which the work world is conceived of as a machine and mechanized accordingly, it becomes the potential basis of a new freedom for man. — location: [646](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=646) ^ref-55999

---
Contemporary industrial civilization demonstrates that it has reached the stage at which “the free society” can no longer be adequately defined in the traditional terms of economic, political, and intellectual liberties, not because these liberties have become insignificant, but because they are too significant — location: [648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=648) ^ref-22611

---
Thus economic freedom would mean freedom from the economy—from being controlled by economic forces and relationships; freedom from the daily struggle for existence, from earning a living. Political freedom would mean liberation of the individuals from politics over which they have no effective control. Similarly, intellectual freedom would mean the restoration of individual thought now absorbed by mass communication and indoctrination, abolition of “public opinion” together with its makers. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=652) ^ref-26528

---
The intensity, the satisfaction and even the character of human needs, beyond the biological level, have always been preconditioned. Whether or not the possibility of doing or leaving, enjoying or destroying, possessing or rejecting something is seized as a need depends on whether or not it can be seen as desirable and necessary for the prevailing societal institutions and interests. In this sense, human needs are historical needs and, to the extent to which the society demands the repressive development of the individual, his needs themselves and their claim for satisfaction are subject to overriding critical standards. — location: [658](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=658) ^ref-44920

---
We may distinguish both true and false needs. “False” are those which are superimposed upon the individual by particular social interests in his repression: the needs which perpetuate toil, aggressiveness, misery, and injustice. — location: [663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=663) ^ref-13988
