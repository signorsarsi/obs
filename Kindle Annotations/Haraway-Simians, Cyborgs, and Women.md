## Highlights
It's not just that 'god' is dead; so is the 'goddess'. — location: [3311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3311) ^ref-29730

Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. — location: [3329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3329) ^ref-2593

To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals - in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. — location: [3637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3637) ^ref-15325

---
The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many. — location: [3640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3640) ^ref-17080

There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture's fear, love, and confusion. — location: [3648](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3648) ^ref-48269

story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? — location: [3655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00CXU3EQ2&location=3655) ^ref-16446
