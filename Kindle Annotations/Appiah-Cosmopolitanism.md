## Highlights
In a 1788 essay in his journal Teutscher Merkur, Christoph Martin Wieland—once called the German Voltaire—wrote, in a characteristic expression of the ideal, “Cosmopolitans…regard all the peoples of the earth as so many branches of a single family, and the universe as a state, of which they, with innumerable other rational beings, are citizens, promoting together under the general laws of nature the perfection of the whole, while each in his own fashion is busy about his own well-being.” — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=132) ^ref-40610

noble partiality which is man’s best strength, the closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical— — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=172) ^ref-15341

that bird’s-eye reasonableness which soars to avoid preference and loses all sense of quality, for the generous reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder with men of like inheritance. — location: [173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=173) ^ref-29210

I want to hold on to at least one important aspect of the objectivity of values: that there are some values that are, and should be, universal, just as there are lots of values that are, and must be, local. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=231) ^ref-29671

All Faith is false, all Faith is true: Truth is the shattered mirror strown In myriad bits; while each believes His little bit the whole to own. — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=298) ^ref-22368

Now, you might think that anthropologists, whose lives begin with this intellectual curiosity about other peoples, are bound to be cosmopolitans. Not so. While they do share, by necessity, a cosmopolitan curiosity about strangers, many anthropologists mistrust talk about universal morality, and spend a great deal of time urging us not to intervene in the lives of other societies; if they think we have a responsibility, it is to leave well enough alone. — location: [418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=418) ^ref-61634

A lingering suspicion that a lot of what we take to be right and wrong is simply a matter of local custom has hardened, in the modern age, into a scientific certainty that talk of objective moral “truths” is just a conceptual error. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=460) ^ref-30698

John Maynard Keynes used to say that those who claimed that they were just talking common sense were often simply in the grip of an old theory. — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003DX0HZO&location=464) ^ref-22728
