## Highlights
a Catholic Sister visited Bob for a conversation, one which he recalled vividly fifteen years later. “Where do you find in history the first reference to servant?” she asked. Bob replied, “In the Bible, of course. I’ve checked the concordance and I found thirteen hundred references to servant.” She then asked sharply, “Why then do you attribute what you have written to Hermann Hesse?” He answered, “Because that’s where I got the idea of the servant as leader. If I had not read Journey to the East, I may never have written anything on this subject.” Then, like a good Quaker, he continued, “The Bible did not end revelation. In my belief, revelation is continuous.”23 — location: [4938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2ENG&location=4938) ^ref-12048

idealist to the core, Bob had unlimited confidence in the power of ideals… At times I found him simplistic in his confidence in those notions. The ideal of the “servant leader” was one of those large abstractions. It only made sense to me as an abstraction lifted out of the Christian tradition. He and I parted company on this matter… I am sure he found me much too “theological,” while I thought he had placed his ultimate trust in several thin abstractions that would not finally bear the weight he placed upon them.25 Ken Blanchard says something similar; “I know Bob felt that we should be citizens of the world. Countries were arbitrary, and he was 279concerned about religions separating us, but I think that servant leadership without a spiritual foundation is just another management technique. — location: [4949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005LY2ENG&location=4949) ^ref-12276
