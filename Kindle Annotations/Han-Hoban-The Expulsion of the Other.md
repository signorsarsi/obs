Money is a poor bestower of identity. It can replace identity, however, for money gives its owner at least a feeling of security and calm. Someone who does not even have money, however, has nothing – neither identity nor security. Thus — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=344) ^ref-36297

Neoliberalism is anything but the endpoint of the Enlightenment. — location: [378](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=378) ^ref-42847

---
The freedom which neoliberalism purports to be is an advertisement. — location: [380](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=380) ^ref-60258

---
People willingly exploit themselves under the illusion of realizing themselves. It is not the suppression of freedom, but rather its exploitation that maximizes productivity and efficiency. This is the perfidious logic that underlies neoliberalism. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=381) ^ref-60308

---
In the face of the violence of the global, the concern must be to protect the universal from co-option by the global. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=383) ^ref-13901

Kant presumably failed to recognize the diabolical, indeed reasonless nature of the spirit of trade. — location: [397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=397) ^ref-27473

---
The EU as a European freetrade zone, a treaty community comprising governments and their nation-state interests, is not what Kant would consider a product of reason, a reason-based ‘league of nations’. Only a constitutional community committed to universal values such as human dignity could be considered reason-based. — location: [401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=401) ^ref-19090

---
Kant’s idea of perpetual peace brought about by reason reaches its climax in his call for unconditional hospitality, which would give every person the right to reside in a foreign country. — location: [404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=404) ^ref-34469

Authenticity is ultimately the self’s neoliberal form of production; it makes every person the producer of themselves. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=480) ^ref-31112

---
For a stable self only comes about in the face of the Other; but excessive, narcissistic self-reference creates a feeling of emptiness. — location: [509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=509) ^ref-29316

results when there is no longer any object charged with libido. The world thus becomes empty and senseless. — location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=518) ^ref-25789

---
Eros alone animates the organism. The same applies to society; excessive narcissism de-stabilizes it. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=528) ^ref-5607

---
To have a stable self-esteem, I am dependent on the notion that I am important for other people, that I am loved by them. It may be diffuse, but it is indispensable for the feeling of being important. — location: [532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=532) ^ref-29622

Holding on to the positive, however, only reproduces the Same. There is not only a hell of negativity, but also a hell of positivity. Terror originates not only from the negative, but also from the positive. — location: [635](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=635) ^ref-12819

This forced transparency eliminates every gap of vision and information, handing everything over to complete visibility. It causes all spaces of retreat and protection to disappear; thus everything moves threateningly close to us. There is nothing to shield us. We ourselves become no more than transits amid the global network. Transparency and hypercommunication deprive us of any protective inwardness.

Today, we live in a post-Marxist age. In the neoliberal regime, exploitation no longer takes place as alienation and self-derealization, but as freedom, as self-realization and self-optimization. — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=797) ^ref-23003

an alienation from the world or from work, but rather a destructive self-alienation: alienation from oneself. — location: [805](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B078X2VND7&location=805) ^ref-7335
