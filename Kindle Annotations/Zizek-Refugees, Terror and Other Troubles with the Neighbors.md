Two main answers present themselves, two versions of ideological blackmail, which make us irreparably guilty. Left liberals, expressing their outrage at how Europe is allowing thousands to drown in the Mediterranean, state that Europe should show solidarity, should open its doors widely. Anti-immigrant populists, on the other hand, claim that we should protect our way of life, pull up the drawbridge and let Africans or Arabs solve their own problems. Both solutions are bad, but which is worse? To paraphrase Stalin, they are both worse. — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=113) ^ref-2759

do. The next taboo that we must discard is the all too fast equation of the European emancipatory legacy to cultural imperialism and racism: many on the Left tend to dismiss any mention of ‘European values’ as the ideological form of Eurocentric colonialism. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=229) ^ref-58873

Global capitalism has no problem in accommodating itself to a plurality of local religions, cultures, traditions: indeed, the mask of cultural diversity is sustained by the actual universalism of global capital. And this new global capitalism functions even better if it is politically organized according to the so-called ‘Asian values,’ i.e., in an authoritarian way. So the cruel irony of anti-Eurocentrism is that, on behalf of anti-colonialism, one criticizes the West at the very historical moment when global capitalism no longer needs Western cultural values in order to function smoothly, and is doing — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=235) ^ref-59525

needs to be said that the true threat to our common way of life does not come in the shape of refugees but lies in the dynamic of global capitalism. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=249) ^ref-53621

And yet another Leftist taboo that needs to be abandoned is that of prohibiting any critique of Islam as a case of ‘Islamophobia.’ — location: [257](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=257) ^ref-33241

One can be sure that the same holds true for the influx of refugees: the more Western Europe is open to them, the more it will be made to feel guilty that it failed to accept even more of them, that it can never accept enough. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=265) ^ref-31253

further, much more subtle, taboo to be left behind is the equation of politicized religion with fanaticism, and the related portrayal of Islamists as pre-modern ‘irrational’ fanatics.

is sheer madness to think that such a process can be left to unwind freely: if nothing else, refugees need provisions and medical care. One has to admit that in 2015 Germany demonstrated unexpected openness in accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees. (One wonders if the secret reason for this German magnanimity is not the need to wash away the bitter taste of how Greece was treated earlier in the same year.) What is needed to stop the chaos is large-scale coordination and organization: the establishment of reception centres close to the very core of the crisis (Turkey, Lebanon, the Syrian coast, the north African coast), where thousands have to be registered and scanned; the organized — location: [1168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1168) ^ref-22486

centres in Europe; and their redistribution to their potential sites of settlement. The military is the only agent that can undertake such a big task in an organized way. To claim that giving the military such a role smells of ‘state of emergency’ is simply hypocritical: a situation in which tens of thousands pass through densely populated areas without any organization is indeed a state of emergency, and parts of Europe are in one right now. — location: [1173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1173) ^ref-19046

limited, if for no other reason than that it doesn’t exist even among the refugees: who—especially with regard to class position—is able to overcome all the obstacles and enter Europe is obviously a matter of financial privilege, among other things.57 — location: [1179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1179) ^ref-10433

Furthermore, it is a simple fact that most of the refugees come from a culture that is incompatible with Western European notions of human rights. — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1182) ^ref-45138

If Muslims find it impossible to bear our blasphemous images and reckless humour (which we consider a part of our freedoms), Western liberals also find it impossible to bear many practices (such as the subordination of women) that are part of the Muslim life-world. — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1184) ^ref-54132

short, situations explode when members of a religious community experience as blasphemous injury and a danger to their way of life not a direct attack on their religion, but the very way of life of another community: — location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1186) ^ref-33829

One should reject the predominant Left-liberal humanitarian attitude. Complaints that moralize the situation—the mantras of ‘Europe has lost empathy; it is indifferent towards the suffering of others,’ and so on—are merely the obverse of racist anti-immigrant brutality. They share the presupposition—which is in no way self-evident—that a defence of one’s own way of life excludes ethical universalism. — location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1193) ^ref-47587

The only way to break out of this deadlock is to move beyond mere tolerance of others. Don’t just respect others: offer them a common struggle, since our problems today are common; propose and fight for a positive universal project shared by all participants.58 — location: [1206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1206) ^ref-20709

There are in fact four such antagonisms: the looming threat of ecological catastrophe; the more and more palpable failure of private property to integrate into its functioning so-called ‘intellectual property’; the socio-ethical implications of new techno-scientific developments (especially — location: [1242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1242) ^ref-11332

the commons of culture, the immediately socialized forms of ‘cognitive’ capital, primarily language—our means of communication and education—but also the shared infrastructure of public transport, electricity, mail, etc. (If Bill Gates were to be allowed a monopoly, we would have reached the absurd situation in which a private individual had literally taken ownership of the software texture of our basic network of communication); – the commons of external nature, threatened by pollution and exploitation (from oil to forests and the natural habitat itself); – the commons of internal nature (the biogenetic inheritance of humanity): with new biogenetic technology, the creation of a New Man in the literal sense of changing human nature becomes a realistic prospect. — location: [1249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1249) ^ref-42205
