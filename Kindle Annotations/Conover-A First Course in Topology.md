## Highlights
You may recall that, in Euclidean geometry, the words “point” and “line” are not defined. — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00IZUEFTY&location=231) ^ref-56296

This failure to define terms is not because of laziness or sloppiness, though; the fact is that in any system of human thought we have to start somewhere, so there must always be some primitive notions that cannot be defined because we have nothing to define them in terms of. — location: [232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00IZUEFTY&location=232) ^ref-37761
