## Highlights
Justice is primarily a possible, but not a necessary, quality of a social order regulating the mutual relations of men. Only secondarily it is a virtue of man, since a man is just, if his behavior conforms to the norms of a social order supposed to be just. — location: [59](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P392DV2&location=59) ^ref-18575

But what does it really mean to say that a social order is just? It means that this order regulates the behavior of men in a way satisfactory to all men, that is to say, so that all men find their happiness in it. — location: [61](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P392DV2&location=61) ^ref-53643
