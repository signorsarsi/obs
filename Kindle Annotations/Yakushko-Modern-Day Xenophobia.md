One of the more malicious aspects of justifying xenophobia is biologizing and universalizing this form of prejudice , such as in those who employ social Darwinism , eugenics , and contemporary “evolutionary” theories of differences. — location: [2598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2598) ^ref-7483

In addition, like other forms of prejudice , xenophobia is proposed to reflect apparently realistic or accurate human attitudes while, in fact, reproducing false stereotypical and fictitious views of individual groups. These views contribute to, reinforce, and underlie immigrants’ social death . — location: [2605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2605) ^ref-20312

Moreover, xenophobia, similar to all forms of prejudice , require splitting them into all-good (i.e., hard-working, happy or nerds) or all-bad (i.e., “wretched refuse,” criminal, immoral) people. This splitting , reflecting psychologically crude defenses, requires that immigrants remain either child-like, needing help, and desperate (i.e., “wretched refuse”) to maintain a relationship that perceives them as dependent, unthreatening, and deprived. This immigrant position requires the native-born individual either to respond with supposed empathy and help or (more likely) evoke unconscious or implicit resentment of giving out previous personal and collective resources away from native-born people.

First, immigrants must be made human. — location: [2637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2637) ^ref-35498

xenophobia is to historicize and contextualize immigration. — location: [2643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2643) ^ref-34047

Thus, another important step is to harness the horror and humility by recognizing the horror of both conditions that make individuals move across borders, especially without legal protection, or humility or genuine sense of guilt in relation to how dominant cultures often create immigration and then punish the immigrants. — location: [2647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2647) ^ref-58629

The final suggestion is to permit immigrant subjectivity by inviting immigrant stories while knowing that their stories may reflect the dominant discourse, that they must be always happy, compliant, hardworking and silent. — location: [2650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07KNK6K7Z&location=2650) ^ref-56613
