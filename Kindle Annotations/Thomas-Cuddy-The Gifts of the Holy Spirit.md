Thus, those who are conducted by the Spirit are moved not as slaves but as free men, willingly and voluntarily, since the principles which move them, though derived from the Spirit, are inherent in their very souls. — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=806) ^ref-43550

Thus, as Cajetan remarks, although the exterior expressions and works of a spiritual man may be observed, the sources from which they spring and the divine end to which they tend cannot be known. — location: [823](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=823) ^ref-62915

Knowest thou not, or hast thou not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, who hath created the ends of the earth: he shall not faint, nor labour, neither is there any searching out of his wisdom. It is he that gives strength to the weary, and increases force and might to those who are not. Youths shall faint and labour, and young men shall fall by infirmity (being — location: [834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=834) ^ref-57448

And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom, and of understanding, the spirit of counsel, and of fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness. And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord.15 — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=848) ^ref-62213

. Furthermore, these gifts are called habits or celestial gifts of the Spirit, because they are regulated by divine inspiration. — location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=929) ^ref-28474

Blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see God.13 — location: [2030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2030) ^ref-10424

---
The gift of understanding does not sharpen and perfect the mind through study and metaphysical inquiry, but by mystical connaturality and union with divine truths. This union and connaturality is not in the order of being but in the order of love and is an aspiration of the will, called mystical to differentiate it from philosophical knowledge, acquired by study or speculative inquiry. — location: [2332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2332) ^ref-46785

---
Mere speculation moves the will but little—except to vanity. Science leads to pride. But the knowledge which moves a man toward a right ordering of love, in attaining greater experience of divine things, pertains to the gift of understanding. — location: [2334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2334) ^ref-7747

very important

---
There is no reason why there should be an experiential knowledge of virtue in virtuous men and should not be such knowledge from a supernatural communication by which a man is moved by the Holy Spirit. If a temperate man can judge of chastity from his exercise of it, no less than a philosopher from his speculation about it, why cannot a man know and judge of divine truths from his love and experience of them? — location: [2351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2351) ^ref-1822

---
Furthermore, understanding differs from the other gifts of the Holy Spirit, namely wisdom, knowledge and counsel. They proceed in an analytic fashion, as is customary in science and prudence, yet their analysis differs from the intellectual virtue, as will be noted later, in the consideration of divine things and in the consideration of human actions. The gift of understanding, on the other hand, employs a simple judgment and intuition built upon a penetration of the terms, in a way similar to the habit of first principles. — location: [2372](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2372) ^ref-8196

---
The gift of understanding, on the other hand, strives to get within the object and to penetrate its interior aspects. “How shall this be done?”62 the blessed Virgin asked the angel. This question was not caused by any diffidence or hesitation. It was brought about by the gift of understanding seeking a full interior understanding of the mystery, in so far as it can be understood in this life. — location: [2409](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2409) ^ref-56710

---
For this reason, faith may be found in sinners, who are without grace and who cannot have the gift of understanding. — location: [2418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2418) ^ref-6464

---
. In general, the object of the gift of understanding is whatever lies hidden and impenetrable to the light of natural reason. Along with St. Thomas, Cajetan64 notes six kinds of objects. Therefore, the gift should be used for the penetration of these six types of objects, which lie hidden. A thing may lie hidden either under accidents, or under words, or under figures or similitudes, or under appearances attained by the senses, or under its causes, or under its effects. Whatever lies hidden under these six veils forms the object of the gift of understanding. — location: [2423](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2423) ^ref-35754

---
Under words — location: [2434](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2434) ^ref-38769

---
Beneath sensible appearances lie hidden intelligible and spiritual things, such as angels and God, known only by the removal of imperfections. — location: [2438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2438) ^ref-50652

---
Effects lie hidden under the causes. For example, grace is concealed in the sacraments, Redemption and all its effects in the Passion of Christ. — location: [2439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2439) ^ref-63603

---
Enveloped in causes are all their effects. For example, under the effects of Divine Predestination is the infinite abyss of the judgment of God. — location: [2440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2440) ^ref-15341

---
No difficulty should arise from the fact that many of these things can be known by study, especially by the study of theology. For, as St. Thomas often affirms, the natural light of reason is of only a finite power. — location: [2443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2443) ^ref-51996

---
The gift of understanding has as its primary purpose such a purity of heart in the intellect. By eliciting a correct understanding of spiritual things, it purges away errors and removes sensible images. Of itself it does not bring about a cleanness from evil effects in the will and sensitive appetite, for that type of purity of heart is the result of the virtues and gifts in the will and sensitive appetite. — location: [2464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2464) ^ref-4977

---
There are two important notes to be added to this consideration. The first is that it is one thing to have emotions which lie dormant, quite another to have emotions which are cleansed. — location: [2467](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2467) ^ref-36095

---
Christ Our Lord said, every branch that bears fruit he will cleanse, that it may bear more fruit.69 The branch bearing fruit already has the gifts of the Holy Spirit whose effects are the — location: [2471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2471) ^ref-49363

---
The cleansing of the affections and emotions from anything mortally sinful is presupposed to the gift of understanding. — location: [2475](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2475) ^ref-26643

---
Hence, it must be denied that the emotions leading to mortal sin can flourish in those who have the gift of understanding. — location: [2476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2476) ^ref-11439

In Heaven the Gift of Understanding is Distinct from the Light of Glory — location: [2534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2534) ^ref-45419

---
St. Thomas continually affirms that the act of this gift in heaven is the vision of God and the perfect and positive evidence of divine things and the mysteries of faith. — location: [2538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2538) ^ref-53307

---
In the face of this, St. Thomas86 attributes the perfect vision of God in heaven to the gift of understanding. — location: [2540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2540) ^ref-41635

---
“The gift of understanding, whose province it is to apprehend in heaven spiritual things, attains to the divine essence by immediate experience.” Therefore, the gift of understanding will be the light of glory itself, since this alone attains the divine essence by immediate experience. — location: [2547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2547) ^ref-28498

---
Therefore, the gift of understanding does not endure in heaven, since the gift is not the light of glory, yet in heaven it is the principle of the immediate experience of the divine essence, the light of glory. — location: [2550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2550) ^ref-48953

---
In heaven, vision takes the place of faith. The gift of understanding is then regulated through vision and attains to an intimate knowledge, just as in this life it illumines the mind concerning the things which have been heard and it attains to the things heard with a special certitude. — location: [2575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2575) ^ref-45207

---
It must be presupposed, then, that the gift of wisdom is ordained to a resolutory and analytic judgment of divine things—not to the simple judgment in the understanding of principles. For wisdom — location: [2949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2949) ^ref-6887

---
6. The formal nature by which wisdom knows the highest causes is an internal experience of God and divine things. It is a taste, love, delight, or internal contact, of the will with spiritual things. By reason of its union with spiritual truths the soul is, as it were, made connatural to things divine. Through this tasting wisdom discerns spiritual truths from the sensible and created. — location: [2953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2953) ^ref-59239

---
Faith is a simple knowledge of those articles which are the principles of all christian wisdom: the gift of wisdom goes on to a certain divine and in a way explicit contemplation of the articles held by faith in an undeveloped human way. Hence wisdom is a gift and faith a virtue. — location: [2971](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2971) ^ref-29666

---
The gift of wisdom is not just any sort of wisdom but the spirit of wisdom. It proceeds from love and a spirit, from a giving by which men experience within themselves how good the will of God is. In it they rejoice and through it they judge perfectly of divine things. Therefore, the formal aspect under which the gift of wisdom reaches the highest cause, the divine cause, is an experiential knowledge of God, in which He is united to the soul in its very depths and gives Himself to it. This is the meaning of “knowing by the Spirit,” knowing not from an illumination or speculation on the divine nature, but through a loving experience of union. — location: [2989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=2989) ^ref-38645

---
Faith is found in sinners who have not grace. The gift of wisdom is found only in the just: For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.17 — location: [3057](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3057) ^ref-14425

---
The gift of wisdom differs from faith, because faith assents to truth taken in itself, but judgment according to divine truth is the province of the gift of wisdom. Hence, the gift of wisdom presupposes faith, since each man judges well what he knows, as is mentioned in the first Book of the Ethics.”22 — location: [3072](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3072) ^ref-51854

---
The distinction of the gift of wisdom from the gifts of understanding and counsel is also quite evident. — location: [3114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3114) ^ref-48816

---
It is distinct from the gift of understanding, because the latter does not proceed analytically, any more than does faith, nor does it treat of causes. Understanding is merely a simple knowledge of terms and a penetration of them in a loving and mystical way. — location: [3115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3115) ^ref-45302

---
Wisdom is distinct from the gift of counsel because the latter is concerned with the government of actions, not with the contemplation of divine things through their ultimate causes proper to wisdom. — location: [3117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3117) ^ref-50620

depend. The relation of the gift of counsel and the gift of wisdom is as follows: The gift of counsel directs immediately the actions of the soul moved by the Holy Spirit to choose correctly and well and to find the mean even in things which are very doubtful. It is noted in the Book of the Machabees: Good counsel came into their minds.36 The gift of wisdom, on the other hand, is not immediately regulative of activity. It contemplates divine things, both as they are in themselves, and, secondarily, as they are the higher rule of action. Activity is still immediately directed by human — location: [3158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0744M3F6Z&location=3158) ^ref-23680
