"First I shall relate for you the tale of Cleobis and Biton, the Argive youths.* They say that their mother was priestess of Hera, and when the time had come for her to go up to the temple, and the mules that always drew her wagon were late in arriving, and the hour was pressing, these young men put themselves to the wagon and drew their mother to the temple ; and she, overjoyed at the devotion of her sons, prayed that the best boon that man can receive be given them by the goddess. They then lay dovvTi to sleep and never arose again, the goddess granting them death as a reward for their devotion."
