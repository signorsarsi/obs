*« y years the political philosophy of responsible government has been a neglected field in American political science. Characteristic of this period was the complete rejection of natural law, the standard by which, traditionally, government relations were judged. Law and rights emanated from the states. Under democratic regimes it w a s held that majority will created law »*([4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=4&annotation=MSZTJDI6))


 *« We hold these truths to be self-evident,  that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are  Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. »*([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=8&annotation=35Y357XF))


 *« Does this nation in its maturity still cherish the faith in which it was conceived and  raised? »*([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=8&annotation=LRYPHZR6))


 *« Does it still hold those "truths to be self-evident"?  About a generation ago, an American diplomat could still say  that "the natural and the divine foundation of the rights of  man . . . is self-evident to all Americans." »*([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=8&annotation=RFU3HCDV))


 *« At about the same  time a German scholar could still describe the difference between German thought and that of Western Europe and the  United States by saying that the West still attached decisive  importance to natural right, while in Germany the very terms  "natural right" and "humanity" "have now become almost  incomprehensible . . . and have lost altogether their original  life and color." »*([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=8&annotation=SXY7KLPD))


 *« German thought has' 'created the historical sense," and thus was led eventually  to unqualified relativism. »*([8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=8&annotation=5XIUGBJL))


 *« The majority among the learned who still adhere to the principles of the Declaration of Independence interpret these principles not as expressions of natural right but as an ideal, if not as an ideology or a myth. »*([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=9&annotation=PJCEQTUH))


 *« Present-day American social science, as far as it is not Roman Catholic social science, is dedicated to the proposition that all men are endowed by the evolutionary process or by a mysterious fate with many kinds of urges and aspirations, but certainly with no natural right »*([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=9&annotation=56IXBVGC))


 *« Nevertheless, the need for natural right is as evident today as it has been for centuries and even millennia. »*([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=9&annotation=4TKMESUP))


 *« To reject natural right is tantamount to saying that all right is positive right, and this means that what is right is determined exclusively by the legislators and the courts of the various countries. »*([9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=9&annotation=ZFLLLG4K))


 *« And, since the ideal of our society is admittedly changing, nothing except dull and stale habit could prevent us from placidly accepting a change in the direction of cannibalism. »*([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=10&annotation=ATNY3SDW))


 *« That standard cannot be found in the needs of the various societies, for the societies and their parts have many needs that conflict with one another: the problem of priorities arises »*([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=10&annotation=LB8E6H32))


 *« This problem cannot be solved in a rational manner if we do not have a standard w i t h reference to which we can distinguish between genuine needs and fancied needs and discern the hierarchy of the various types of genuine needs. »*([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=10&annotation=9BXWMF5R))


 *« The problem posed by the conflicting needs of society cannot be solved if we do not possess knowledge of natural right. »*([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=10&annotation=RWPMHHVJ))


 *« ight.  It would seem, then, that the rejection of natural right is bound to lead to disastrous consequences. And it is obvious that consequences which are regarded as disastrous by many men and even by some of the most vocal opponents of natural right do follow from the contemporary rejection of natural right. »*([10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=10&annotation=PKGSI9UW))


 *« According to our social science, we can be or  become wise in all matters of secondary importance, but we  have to be resigned to utter ignorance in the most important  respect: we cannot have any knowledge regarding the ultimate principles of our choices, i.e., regarding their soundness  or unsoundness; our ultimate principles have no other support  than our arbitrary and hence blind preferences. »*([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=11&annotation=FXVEEQ9Q))


 *« We are then  in the position of beings who are sane and sober when engaged  in trivial business and who gamble like madmen when confronted with serious issues—retail sanity and wholesale madness. »*([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=11&annotation=QXFDP7J7))


 *« If our principles have no other support than our blind  preferences, everything a man is willing to dare w i l l be per »*([11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=11&annotation=X3NT77BJ))


 *« missible. The contemporary rejection of natural right leads to nihilism—nay, it is identical with nihilism. »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=2VJ6A8MK))


 *« They appear to believe that our inability to acquire any genuine knowledge of what is intrinsically good or right compels us to be tolerant of every opinion about good or right or to recognize all preferences or all "civilizations" as equally respectable. »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=M5WAN74P))


 *« Only unlimited tolerance is in accordance with reason »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=PHSNSSMC))


 > >Scritto nel 1953 *« But this leads to the admission of a rational or natural right of every preference that is tolerant of other preferences or, negatively expressed, of a rational or natural right to reject or condemn all intolerant or all "absolutist" positions. The latter must be condemned because they are based on a demonstrably false premise, namely, that men can know what is good. »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=W2VDE2QK))


 *« At the bottom of the passionate rejection of all "absolutes," we discern the recognition of a natural right or, more precisely, of that particular interpretation of natural right according to which the one thing needful is respect for diversity or individuality »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=XKDGYKX5))


 *« When liberals became impatient of the absolute limits to diversity or individuality that are imposed even by the most liberal version of natural right, they had to make a choice between natural right and the uninhibited cultivation of individuality. They chose the latter. Once this step was taken, tolerance appeared as one value or ideal among many, and not intrinsically superior to its opposite. »*([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=12&annotation=94DY2LRN))


 > >Ció che appare ora con la "cancel culture". Liberalismo illiberale lo definiva l'Economist *« Liberal relativism has its roots in the natural right tradition of tolerance or in the notion that everyone has a natural right to the pursuit of happiness as he understands happiness; but in itself it is a seminary of intolerance. »*([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBM3UIY8?page=13&annotation=Y8KINE2V))
