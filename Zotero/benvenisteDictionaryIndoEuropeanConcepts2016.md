 « Thémis »([413](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=413&annotation=YDDFLEAA))


 « The root common to Skt. rta, Iran. arta, Lat. ars, artus, ritus, which designates "order" as a harmonious arrangement of the parts of a whole, did not provide any  juridical term in Indo-European. »([413](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=413&annotation=DRJX84Z2))


 « "Law" is in Skt. dhâman and in Gr. thémis, and the term means literally the rule  established (root *dhë- 'to bring into existence') by the gods. »([413](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=413&annotation=C4N3CQT6))


  > >order « We eau in the :first place posit for common Indo-European an extremely  important concept, that of "order." It is represented by Vedic rta, Iranian arta  (Avestan asa, by a special phonetic development). »([414](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=414&annotation=TCVPQLW8))


 « We have here one of the  cardinal notions ofthe legal world ofthe Indo-European, to say nothing of their  religious and moral ideas: thls is the concept of "Order," which govems also  the orderliness of the universe, the movement of the stars, the regularity of the  seasons and the years; further, the relations of gods and men; and finally, the  relations of men to one another. Nothing which concems man or the world falls  outside the realm of"Ortler." »([414](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=414&annotation=M3GTEVQ8))


 « at. ars, artis, 'natural  disposition, qualification, talent'; others with -tu-, e.g. Lat. artus 'joint' and  also, with a different fonn of the root, ritus 'rite'; Gr. artus (Arm. ard, genitive ardu 'order'), as well as the present tense artuno 'arrange, equip'; with  *-dhmo-, Gr. arthm6s 'bond, league, friendship'; and finally with *-dhi·o-, Gr.  arthron 'joint, limb'. »([414](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=414&annotation=QKF4E62G))


  > >law « In Vedic Sanskrit we find first the term dharma-, neuter dharman, which  is equivalent to "law," but the proper sense is "what is maintained, held fast"  (from dhar- 'to hold'), and, according to the context, "custom, rule, usage." It  is a term of great importance in religion, philosophy,. and also in law, but it is  confined to India. »([415](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=415&annotation=5BBTSX92))


 > >1  > >seat « law is  in the first place an "establishment," an institution that is founded and so takes  on existence. »([415](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=415&annotation=NE7QW3KQ))


 « Apart from the quantity of the root vowel, thémis is exactly comparable  to the Avestan do.mi- as regards its formation, and this equation is remarkable  because suffixation with -mis, like that seen in dunamis, is extremely rare. This  makes it probable that thémis is a word of great antiquity and that it has undergone morphological modifications which tended to normalize an archaic mode  of declension. »([416](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=416&annotation=GVPB59YR))


 « Now, what does thémis mean? Here we have a striking  correlation: thémis designates family law as opposed to dikê, which is law that  holds good among the families that make up a tribe.1 »([416](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=416&annotation=IFFY5LXW))


 « This point must be stressed, for the dictionaries take no account ofthis distinction. Further, thémis is of divine origin. Only this sense enables us to understand and unify uses which look very different. In the epic, what is understood  under thémis is the prescription which lays down the rights and duties of each  person under the authority ofthe chief of the génos, whether in everyday life or  in exceptional circumstances: alliance, marriage, war.  Thémis is the prerogative of the basileus; it is of heavenly origin, and the  plural thémistes stands for the sum total of these ordinances, which is a code  inspired by the gods, a set of unwritten laws, a collection of dicta, of oracular  responses, which determine, in the conscience of the judge (in actual fact the  head ofthe family), how to proceed every time the order ofthe génos is at stake. »([416](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=416&annotation=5CWKPWRN))


 « This social organization and the thémis which is operative within it is better  brought out by the inverse picture which the poet sketches in his description of  the land of the Cyclops. These, he says, are athémistes; among them there are  neither deliberative assemblies nor thémistes; each one lays down his own law  (themisteûei) to his wife and children and none has regard for the others (Od.  9, 106-115). This provides an illuminating definition of the concept of thémis.  Where there is no génos and no king there can be no thémis or assembly. Each  family lives according to its own law. These Cyclops are certainly savages. »([417](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=417&annotation=3K2DSLMC))


 « "May Zeus and the other gods grantyou all you desire."  Eumaeus replies: "Thémis does not allow me (oû moi thémis ést') to do outrage  to a guest even if one came tome even more wretched than you. For all guests  corne from Zeus and beggars too" (Od. 14, 53ff.). »([417](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=417&annotation=PVDMAFWY))


 « Everything reminds us that this thémis, these thémistes were not invented  or arbitrarily laid down by those who have to apply them: they are of divine  origin. As Nestor says to Agamemnon, son ofAtreus: "You rule over numerous  laof, to you Zeus has entrusted the scepter and the thémistes, so that you can  guide their deliberations" (Il. 9, 97). The king, designated by Zeus, is invested  with these two attributes: one, the scepter, is material; the other is knowledge  of the thémistes. »([418](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=418&annotation=R7AN2VWU))


 « Outside Homeric civilization we find in Indic  dhâman a precise correspondent of thémis: it is the order within the house and  the family established by divine will, that ofMitra and Vanu;ia. »([418](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=418&annotation=VYZKGJ6J))


 « Dikë »([419](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=419&annotation=HASQEUEF))


 « Latin dico and Greek dikë together imply the idea of a formulaic law which  lays down what is to be done in every particular situation. The judge-Hom. dikasp6los-is the one who keeps the formulary and pronounces (dicit) authoritatively the  appropriate sentence. »([419](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=419&annotation=FUE5AS86))


 « The basis of thémis is a root meaning "put, place, establish." »([419](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=419&annotation=WNAANV3H))


 « The root in question is *drâk-, which appears in Sanskrit as dis-, as dis- in  Iranian, as die- in Latin and defk(numi) in Greek. But these forms, though in  perfect formal correspondence, do not agree in meaning, for Greek deiknumi  means "show" and Latin dico 'say'. It will be necessary, therefore, to undertake  an analysis to elicit the sense which will explain why dfkë in Greek has the  sense of "justice." »([420](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6EF9WETY?page=420&annotation=URR7D2EC))
