« § 40. Sequitur ut admoneamus apud peregrinos quidem unum esse [[dominium]] ; nam aut dominus quisque est, a.ut dominus non intelle!Titur. quo iure etiam popuiu;' Romanus »([204](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SW7KAC7E?page=204&annotation=HRN2DM2M))


 « §§ 40, 41. Roman law originally only recognized one kind of ownership, called emphatically, quiritary ownership. Gradually, however, certain kinds of ownership were recognized which, though they failed to satisfy all the elements of the definition of quiritary dominion, were practically its equivalent, and received from the courts a similar protection. »([209](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SW7KAC7E?page=209&annotation=F263XPH5))


 « The alien (peregrinus) on the contrary was incapable, except by special privilege: yet he might have ownership, which he acquired by titles of jus gentium, e g. tradition, occupation, accession, &c., and could maintain by a real action in the court of the praetor peregrinus or praeses provinciae. »([210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SW7KAC7E?page=210&annotation=C8MBYRG3))


 « But in the provinces subsequently conquered, fond continued to the end subject ex.elusively to public dominion; and thus one of the essential features of feudal tenure, the exclusive vesting of absolute or ultimate dominion over land in the sovereign as overlord, a principle commonly supposed to have been first introduced into Europe by the invadiug German hordes, had already existed, though in a different form, over by far the greater portion of the Roman world. »([210](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SW7KAC7E?page=210&annotation=U9WK4URW))
