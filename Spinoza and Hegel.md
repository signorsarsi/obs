Is it possible to understand Hegel without [[Spinoza]]? It seems to me that Spinoza create the basis for Hegel. Spinoza's idea of an immanent absolute substancia can be the premise for Hegel. "Deus Sive natura" but also "Geist sive natura". The difference is that Hegel perceives that front the nature but part of the nature is the philosopher. Using the history as a dialectic mechanism he defines that the immanent substancia, the Geist transform itself (Heraclitus  and  Empedocles applied to Spinoza). At the end the spirit, the immanent substance knows itself in itself. Hegel destroys Spinoza, but use some of the Spinoza's device.
