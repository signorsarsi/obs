According to [[Reynolds]],  in  Reynolds, P. L. (2001). PROPERTIES, CAUSALITY AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL OPTIMISM IN THOMAS AQUINAS. _Recherches de Théologie et Philosophie Médiévales_, _68_(2), 270–309.
S. Thomas Aquinas asserts that we can "know, name and define substances" with  [[properties]] . 
Reynolds maintains that for Aquinas "the epistemic value of properties depends on the necessary, consequential relation between properties and their subject "
This relation seems to appear 'ownership' by the object.

Naturally  we can have properties that are not 'ownership' by the object.  For example that a black cow is not visible in a night without light. Or that a man is a murderer only if his victim dies. Something outside the object defines the object. But these would be in a classical meaning not properties but accidents. We know that in the organum for [[Aristotle]]  relation is an accident. This is because substance is it closed to the world and only can be understood not by means of its relations but only by means of essential definitions and at least properties.

This interesting , because we can know something by the means of the expression of something in the world. If something has some property, this property  give me some light on 'something'.
If we try to understand  genetic relations, according to [[Fernando Rielo]] we see that the [[gene]] define the object but is  is not some a of the object but an action outside the object that produce a reaction in the object.

The [[Father]] *agenitus* begets the [[Son]] Unigenitus. And the Son accepts and receive geneticity from the Father..

The [[Divine Constitutive Presence]] , defines us an immanential form . But she is relational presence.

Geneticity is not a property but the present of Other in Other
