According to Bollas *"a normotic person is  someone who is abnormally normal"*
In "[[the Christopher Bollas Reader]]" pag.23

*We may speak of a common normotic element when we identify any mental activity that constitutes a transfer of a subjective state of mind into a material external object that results in the de-symbolization of the mental content. If this element is overutilized, if it is a means towards the evacuation of subjective states of mind, then the person may be subtly moving towards normotic illness. If the normotic element is ordinary, then normotic illness develops when the subjective meaning is lodged in an external object, remains there and is not re-introjected, and over time loses its symbolic function as a signifi er. Normotically disturbed persons successfully house varied parts and functions of their internal world in material objects, and even though they use these objects and collect them into a familiar space, they serve no symbolic purpose. Such an individual is alive in a world of meaningless plenty*
