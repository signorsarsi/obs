## Highlights
- [T]he right to exclude others is more than just “one of the most essential” constituents of property – it is the sine qua non. Give someone the right to exclude others from a valued resource, i.e., a resource that is scarce relative to the human demand for it, and you give them property. Deny someone the exclusion right and they do not have property.10 ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00866GYDC&location=163))
