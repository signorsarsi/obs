## Highlights
- In the Postcolonial New World Order, being a member of a nation in possession of territorial sovereignty is the thing to be(come). It is an aspiration, moreover, that cannot be named as such, for, to be convincing, it must not be seen as an invention but an inheritance. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=152))

- By definition, nations are not an inheritance shared by all. As Benedict Anderson pointed out, societies organized as nations always imagine themselves as limited communities (Anderson 1991). ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=155))

- place. As each nation imagines that it has its own place on earth, Nationals come to see themselves as the “people of a place.” ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=167))
- Rights within national territory are formally guaranteed only for Citizens. This works to make the Migrant the quintessential Other in postcolonial practices of ruling. Migrants are made to be outside of the nation even as they live on national territory. Migrants are those people whose mobility into nation-states is regulated and restricted. Migrants are those people who are legally denied the rights of national citizenship where they live. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=175))
- However, imperial states were primarily concerned with preventing people’s escape from imperial territory. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=196))

- horizontal (and cross-class) sameness among Nationals, institutionalized stark differences between Nationals and Migrants. This communitarian basis of nationalized sovereignties produced a shift from imperial to postcolonial racist strategies (R. Miles 1993, 117).

- Indeed, national citizenship and immigration controls are, together, the key technologies for the material and cultural realization of postcolonial biopower. Disputes over their scope and application are central to the continuous (re)making of the national body politic. As new nations and new nation-states form and older ones dissolve; the unity needed to keep a nation intact is continually challenged. New national liberation movements arise to remake the borders of nationalized territory and set different limits to national belonging. Centripetal as well as centrifugal forces of nationalist thought take place at various state levels: municipal, regional, state, or federal. People may demand that they be reunited with their fellow Nationals (but not fellow citizens) resident in another nation-state’s territory. People may demand more rights for locals over nonlocals in gaining access to property, services, or votes, even when the nonlocals are citizens of the same nation-state. Or they may demand that the nation-state tighten up its immigration controls to better “serve and protect” the nation. Redefining which people are a part of which nation—and which nation should control which territory—secures the body politic as national.

- Being Native, once the denigrated Other to the colonizer, has, in the Postcolonial New World Order, become the quintessential criterion for being a member of the nation. Migrants, unable to cross the racialized boundary of Nativeness (at least in the places they actually live) and unable to organize themselves into a nation, remain “out of place.” ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=269))

- Most troubling, the legal and/or social separation of National-Natives and Migrants animates deadly conflicts around the world. A particularly stark example of this is taking place in Myanmar (formerly Burma), where the separation of National-Natives and Migrants is the basis for what has been termed the world’s most recent genocide, this time against Rohingya people (International State Crime Initiative, Queen Mary University of London, 2015). ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=279))

- Nation-state officials and popular Buddhist monks categorize (mostly) Muslim Rohingya people as “illegal Bengali migrants” and argue that expelling them from both the nation and its sovereign territory is necessary for the defense of national society (see Foucault 1978, 137; Foucault 2003). Over the past four decades, Rohingya people have had their homes and property destroyed; they have been tortured, killed, and placed in camps; their citizenship has been removed; and a growing number have been forced to flee. Having already been socially constituted as Migrants, many have been made Migrants both in national law and in everyday life.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Another stark example of the political work done by separating National-Natives from Migrants is the popular “Save Darfur” movement, which has successfully reframed the economic, political, and ecological legacies of European imperialism in the Darfur region of Sudan as a racialized conflict between “Black African” National-Natives and “light-skinned Arab” Migrants. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=295))
- Probably the best-studied example of the violence ensuing from the separation of National-Natives and Migrants is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, when those acting in the name of Hutus killed approximately 800,000 Tutsis and those Hutus who opposed this mass murder.

- A not dissimilar process took place in the 1991–2002 Yugoslav Wars. Ideas of National-Native belonging fueled the claims to Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Bosnian homelands. In each national territory, people targeted for “ethnic cleansing” were said to be Migrants and thus foreign elements in the national homelands of others. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=304))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- The politics of separating Natives from Migrants is also evident in the former “White Settler” colonies. Here there are two very differently situated claimants to National-Native status. Indigenous National-Natives, colonized by various European empires, maintain that they are the first inhabitants and “first nations,” while White National-Natives claim to be the “first improvers” and “first sovereigns” of these territories. Indigenous-Natives maintain that because they are highly subordinated and lack a separate national sovereignty over ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=315))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Indeed, a growing chorus of Indigenous National-Native opinion asserts that all Migrants are “settler colonists.” ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=330))

- Significantly, in each instance of the aforementioned national politics of autochthony, colonization is conflated with migration. In them, real or imagined human migration—today, hundreds, or even thousands of years ago—is seen as nothing less than colonization. Being a “settler/colonist” is synonymous with being defined as a Migrant to national territory. And “colonialism” becomes nothing more than the existence of Migrants in the “nation.” This is what makes autochthonous politics uncanny. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=336))

- In it, being a Migrant is seen as having no lawful claim to territory, livelihoods, or political membership. Yet being a Migrant is not only a state (juridical) category but also a social one. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=343))
- Consequently, anyone placed outside the limits of the nation can be made a Migrant. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=345))

- In this sense, the national politics of autochthony is marked by nativism. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=346))
- Today, turning Migrants into “colonizers” is part of the politics of nativism informed by calls to “make the nation great again.” ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=350))

- Indeed, discourses of autochthony deployed by some Indigenous National-Natives, for instance, argue that their national sovereignty is essential to taking good care of the planet, each other, and the generations of life to come.

- However, Nativeness is neither an essence nor an analytic tool. It is, instead, a racialized idea and political category allowing some to make claims against others. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=366))

- All autochthonous discourses are also relational. They produce Migrants as the negative others of National-Natives. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=367))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Hence, I argue that the deployment of autochthonous discourses reveals a crucial feature of postcolonial power: all nationalisms are fundamentally autochthonous and productive of a hierarchical separation between National-Natives (autochthons) and Migrants (allochthons).

The actions used to describe the late-twentieth-century breakup of the former Yugoslavia into several new nation-states—“murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property”—are not unique (UN Security Council 1992; also see Shraga and Zacklin ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=392))

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Postcolonialism, far from ending the violent practices and relationships of colonialism, marks the ascendency of the national form of state power and its reliance on nationalist subjectivities, national forms of exclusion, and kinds of violence that nation-states carry out. Postcolonialism is thus, I argue, a form of ruling that substitutes demands for decolonization with demands for national sovereignty. Postcolonialism has indeed ended the legitimacy of imperial states, but not the practices associated with them. Instead, practices of expropriation and exploitation have expanded and intensified in the Postcolonial New World Order.

- By 1941, however, with metropolitan France under Nazi occupation and the British metropole under siege, Britain was desperate for U.S. help in fighting the Axis powers. The United States seized the opportunity to demand a reorganization of the still largely imperial world to its advantage. That year, President Roosevelt succeeded in getting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to accept the extension of the Wilsonian doctrine of self-rule to the Natives in the colonies. Their agreement was sealed in the 1941 Atlantic Charter. However, ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=424))
- Instead, the United States understood that imperial-state monopolies over their colonies prevented capitalists based in the United States from exploiting these same territories and the people in them.

- Hannah Arendt had already understood this in her analysis of the post-WWI efforts of the League of Nations. It was the League’s Minority Treaties, she argued, which legitimized the nationalist idea that political rights flowed from membership in a “nation.” ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=448))
- membership. The signing of various Minority Treaties thus institutionalized the communitarian basis of nation-states and led Arendt ([1951] 1973, 275) to declare that the “nation had conquered the state.” ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=453))

- Unsurprisingly, a pall of “postcolonial melancholia” soon fell over people’s dreams of decolonization (Gilroy 2005). It fell first and hardest over those who had only recently been transformed from the Native subjects of imperial colonies into the National Citizens of “independent” nation-states, those who had actively placed their hopes in the same national liberation states now organizing and exacerbating their impoverishment. But a postcolonial melancholia also enveloped people in the former metropoles that had by the mid-1960s also nationalized their sovereignties. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=505))
- Another way of putting it is that the material basis for the Postcolonial New World Order of nation-states has not diverged fundamentally from the previous imperial world order. Unsurprisingly, it is those people who are not recognized as a People—the “subalterns,” or those who have had no beneficial part of the nation or its state—who are to be found at the losing end of national hierarchies.

- Crucial aspects of this project are a critique of capital that has long been globally operative, a critique of nation-states that usurp people’s freedom to move, and a critique of nationalist subjectivities increasingly insistent on a partition between National-Natives as a “people of a place” and Migrants as “people out of place.” ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=546))

- to whom? Historically, how were people separately constituted as Natives or Migrants? How much is the contemporary nationalist discourse of autochthony a legacy of imperialism? Is the privileging of autochthony merely a defensive position wherein arguments for essential and incommensurable differences are used (strategically or otherwise) to organize against power (see Spivak 1994)? Or are autochthonous discourses formative of power and, if so, what political work do they accomplish? And, perhaps most importantly, what would decolonization look like if we rejected the separation—and the political categories—of Natives and Migrants?

- What each of these examples shows, however, is that the category of National-Native carries enormous legal and moral authority precisely because it is a legacy of the autochthonization of political membership first practiced by imperial states. At the same time, postcolonialism has turned the category of Native on its head. Being Native once marked someone as a subjugated subject of empires. Now, being Native is to make oneself the subject of “national self-determination.” Today, the exemplary National subject is someone laying claim to being a Native of national territory. The imperial binary of European/Native has thus been flipped into the national binary of National-Native/Migrant. Surreally—and dangerously—migration is increasingly portrayed as colonialism. A growing number of National-Natives imagine themselves as being colonized by Migrants. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=817))

- This has not happened. Instead, much old imperialist wine has been repackaged in new national bottles. Global inequalities in a world of nation-states are worse than in the Age of Empires. Disparities across and within nation-states have grown as practices of expropriation and exploitation have intensified in the Postcolonial New World Order. Recognizing this reality is not an argument for a return of empires but is, instead, a call to reject the postcolonial system of nation-states and build social relationships, social bodies, and practices of social reproduction able to meet liberatory demands.

Samir Amin (2004, 8) noted that there was an increase in “the inequality between peoples from a maximum ratio of two to one around 1800, to sixty to one today.” Branko Milanovic (2002, 51) further noted that by the 1990s the income of the wealthiest twenty-five million people in the United States was “equal to [the] total income of almost 2 billion people” in the world. In 2013, eighty-five of the wealthiest people in the world had a combined wealth (about $110 trillion) estimated as equal to that of the bottom 50 percent, or 3.5 billion people (Oxfam 2014).

- This is not because they are prevented from doing so by “neocolonialism,” but because of the national form of state power. Perhaps it is useful, then, to view postcolonialism through the lens of the end of slavery a century or more earlier. Vijay Prashad puts it this way: “Just as the abolition of slavery advanced the cause of human freedom and yet left the formerly enslaved people in decrepit socioeconomic conditions, so too did national independence move history forward and yet do little for the[ir] everyday dilemmas” (Prashad 2007, 224).

- As discussed in chapter 3, the “coolie” indentured labor system replaced slavery, but far from producing the freedom that people demanded, coolieism ushered in a system of labor regulation and rule that shared many of the material conditions of slavery but was less clearly understood as an affront to liberty. Significantly, coolies were controlled not only by the contracts they were forced to sign as a condition of their movement, but also by new immigration controls.

- The transformation of the world system of states from one dominated by imperial states to one now dominated by nation-states has followed a similar trajectory. Just as many failed to see coolieism as the co-optation of workers’ struggles against capitalism, proletarianization, and unfree labor, and saw coolieism as freedom instead, today most fail to see the world of nation-states as having contained anticolonial dreams of liberation. Like coolieism, the postcolonial chains that bind workers to capital and to states remain invisible to many. ([Location 6188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0837NHPRF&location=6188))

- Yet, as the arguments advanced in this book demonstrate, the nation-state is wholly incapable of delivering on the promises of “national self-determination.” This is not because it doesn’t have enough national sovereignty, but because of the global arena in which capitalism operates and because of the relationship between ruling classes and state power. This is glaringly so with regard to national citizenship and immigration controls, which have, from the start, been a response to crises in capitalism.

- From the first controls against the free movement of coolie workers in the British Empire in the early nineteenth century, to the reorganization of the global political order into postcolonial nation-states, citizenship and immigration controls have done two main things: provide flexible and relatively cheaper labor power and politically separate workers within a world market for labor power.
