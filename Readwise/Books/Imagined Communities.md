## Highlights
- ‘The theory of nationalism represents Marxism’s great historical failure.’5 But ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=171))
- It would be more exact to say that nationalism has proved an uncomfortable anomaly for Marxist theory and, precisely for that reason, has been largely elided, rather than confronted. How else to explain Marx’s failure to explicate the crucial adjective in his memorable formulation of 1848: ‘The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie’?

- My point of departure is that nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word’s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular kind. To ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=181))
- The objective modernity of nations to the historian’s eye vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists. (2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept – in the modern world everyone can, should, will ‘have’ a nationality, as he or she ‘has’ a gender – vs. the irremediable particularity of its concrete manifestations, such that, by definition, ‘Greek’ nationality is sui generis. (3) The ‘political’ power of nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence. In other words, unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own grand thinkers: no Hobbeses, Tocquevilles, Marxes, or Webers. This ‘emptiness’ easily gives rise, among cosmopolitan and polylingual intellectuals, to a certain condescension.

- In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=206))
- ‘Or l’essence d’une nation est que tous les individus aient beaucoup de choses en commun, et aussi que tous aient oublié bien des choses.’10 With a certain ferocity Gellner ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=210))

- Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=217))

- The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind. The most messianic nationalists do not dream of a day when all ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=223))

- It is imagined as sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OA6KII&location=227))
