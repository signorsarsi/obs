- ‘The primary fact of the Modern Age was not that the earth goes around the sun, but that money goes around the earth.’ ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=85))
- Two main answers present themselves, two versions of ideological blackmail, which make us irreparably guilty. Left liberals, expressing their outrage at how Europe is allowing thousands to drown in the Mediterranean, state that Europe should show solidarity, should open its doors widely. Anti-immigrant populists, on the other hand, claim that we should protect our way of life, pull up the drawbridge and let Africans or Arabs solve their own problems. Both solutions are bad, but which is worse? To paraphrase Stalin, they are both worse. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=113))

- split between the so-called Anglo-Saxon model—accept the idea of ‘modernization’ (shorthand for adaptation to the rules of the new global order)—and the French-German model, which is to preserve as much as possible of the ‘old European’ post-war welfare state. Although ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=167))
- More than a decade ago, Jeremy Rifkin designated this new stage in our economy ‘cultural capitalism.’ ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=202))

- do. The next taboo that we must discard is the all too fast equation of the European emancipatory legacy to cultural imperialism and racism: many on the Left tend to dismiss any mention of ‘European values’ as the ideological form of Eurocentric colonialism.

- Global capitalism has no problem in accommodating itself to a plurality of local religions, cultures, traditions: indeed, the mask of cultural diversity is sustained by the actual universalism of global capital. And this new global capitalism functions even better if it is politically organized according to the so-called ‘Asian values,’ i.e., in an authoritarian way. So the cruel irony of anti-Eurocentrism is that, on behalf of anti-colonialism, one criticizes the West at the very historical moment when global capitalism no longer needs Western cultural values in order to function smoothly, and is doing ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=235))
- Another taboo to be jettisoned is the notion that the protection of one’s specific way of life is in itself a proto-Fascist or racist category. The ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=244))
- needs to be said that the true threat to our common way of life does not come in the shape of refugees but lies in the dynamic of global capitalism. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=249))
- And yet another Leftist taboo that needs to be abandoned is that of prohibiting any critique of Islam as a case of ‘Islamophobia.’ ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=257))

- One can be sure that the same holds true for the influx of refugees: the more Western Europe is open to them, the more it will be made to feel guilty that it failed to accept even more of them, that it can never accept enough.

- further, much more subtle, taboo to be left behind is the equation of politicized religion with fanaticism, and the related portrayal of Islamists as pre-modern ‘irrational’ fanatics.

- With such enlightened friends of the West, who needs fundamentalist enemies? If such a direct legitimization of one’s claim to land by reference to God’s will is not religious fundamentalism, then we should wonder if this term has any meaning at all ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=305))

- is sheer madness to think that such a process can be left to unwind freely: if nothing else, refugees need provisions and medical care. One has to admit that in 2015 Germany demonstrated unexpected openness in accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees. (One wonders if the secret reason for this German magnanimity is not the need to wash away the bitter taste of how Greece was treated earlier in the same year.) What is needed to stop the chaos is large-scale coordination and organization: the establishment of reception centres close to the very core of the crisis (Turkey, Lebanon, the Syrian coast, the north African coast), where thousands have to be registered and scanned; the organized ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LY4E3YY&location=1168))

- centres in Europe; and their redistribution to their potential sites of settlement. The military is the only agent that can undertake such a big task in an organized way. To claim that giving the military such a role smells of ‘state of emergency’ is simply hypocritical: a situation in which tens of thousands pass through densely populated areas without any organization is indeed a state of emergency, and parts of Europe are in one right now.

- One should reject the predominant Left-liberal humanitarian attitude. Complaints that moralize the situation—the mantras of ‘Europe has lost empathy; it is indifferent towards the suffering of others,’ and so on—are merely the obverse of racist anti-immigrant brutality. They share the presupposition—which is in no way self-evident—that a defence of one’s own way of life excludes ethical universalism.
