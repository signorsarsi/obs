## Highlights
- Not only Hegel’s hope that reason would shape and control reality, but Marx’s hope that reason would be embodied in a revolutionary class and rational socialist society, had come to naught. The proletariat was not the “absolute negation of capitalist society presupposed by Marx,” and the contradictions of capitalism were not as explosive as Marx had forecast. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=223))
- Marcuse took over the term “organized capitalism” developed by the Austro-Marxist Rudolf Hilferding to describe the administrative-bureaucratic apparatus which organizes, ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=225))

- Economic planning in the state, automatization in the economy, the rationalization of culture in the mass media, and the increased bureaucratization of all modes of social, political, and economic life had created a “totally administered society” that was resulting in “the decline of the individual.” ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=228))

- In this technological world, Marcuse claims that metaphysics is superseded by technology, in that the previous metaphysical concept of subjectivity, which postulates an active subject confronting a controllable world of objects, is replaced by a one-dimensional technical world where “pure instrumentality” and “efficacy” of arranging means and ends within a pre-established universe is the “common principle of thought and action.” ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=235))

- There are two ways to read Marcuse’s theory of the one-dimensional technical world and society, which is the primary focus of One-Dimensional Man. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=242))

- Thus, I would propose interpreting “one-dimensional” as conforming to existing thought and behavior and lacking a critical dimension and a dimension of potentialities that transcend the existing society. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=255))

- In Marcuse’s usage the adjective “one-dimensional” describes practices that conform to pre-existing structures, norms, and behavior, in contrast to multidimensional discourse, which focuses on possibilities that transcend the established state of affairs. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=256))
- In the one-dimensional society, the subject is assimilated into the object and follows the dictates of external, objective norms and structures, thus losing the ability to discover more liberating possibilities and to engage in transformative practice to realize them. Marcuse’s theory presupposes the existence of a human subject with freedom, creativity, and self-determination who stands in opposition to an object-world, perceived as substance, which contains possibilities to be realized and secondary qualities like values, aesthetic traits, and aspirations, which can be cultivated to enhance human life. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=260))

- In Marcuse’s view, the price that one-dimensional man pays for satisfaction is to surrender freedom and individuality. One-dimensional man does not know its true needs because its needs are not its own—they are administered, superimposed, and heteronomous; it is not able to resist domination, nor to act autonomously, for it identifies with public behavior and imitates and submits to the powers that be. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=267))
- Marcuse is thus a radical individualist who is deeply disturbed by the decline of the traits of authentic individuality that he so highly values. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=270))
    - Note: Qui sta il punto: si parte dal comunismo per arrivare al neoliberismo
- He maintains that the society’s prosperity and growth are based on waste and destruction, its progress fueled by exploitation and repression, while its freedom and democracy are based on manipulation. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=299))
- “this society is irrational as a whole. Its productivity is destructive of the free development of human needs and faculties … its growth dependent on the repression of the real possibilities for pacifying the struggle for existence—individual, national and international” (One-Dimensional Man, pp. ix–x).

- “The union of growing productivity and growing destruction; the brinkmanship of annihilation; the surrender of thought, hope, and fear to the decisions of the powers that be; the preservation of misery in the face of unprecedented wealth constitute the most impartial indictment.… [Society’s] sweeping rationality, which propels efficiency and growth is itself irrational” (One-Dimensional Man, p. xiii).

- Certainly, from the 1980s to the present, conservative trends have been dominant. Yet to present an adequate model for contemporary social theory and politics, forms of both domination and resistance should be analyzed.

- If we attempt to relate the causes of the danger to the way in which society is organized and organizes its members, we are immediately confronted with the fact that advanced industrial society becomes richer, bigger, and better as it perpetuates the danger. The ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=480))
- The political needs of society become individual needs and aspirations, their satisfaction promotes business and the commonweal, and the whole appears to be the very embodiment of Reason. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=483))
- And yet this society is irrational as a whole. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=485))
- Our society distinguishes itself by conquering the centrifugal social forces with Technology rather than Terror, on the dual basis of an overwhelming efficiency and an increasing standard of living. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=490))
- the judgment that human life is worth living, or rather can be and ought to be made worth living. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=498))
- This judgment underlies all intellectual effort; it is the a priori of social theory, and its rejection (which is perfectly logical) rejects theory itself; ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=499))

- Critical analysis has to demonstrate the objective validity of these judgments, and the demonstration has to proceed on empirical grounds. The established society has available an ascertainable quantity and quality of intellectual and material resources. How can these resources be used for the optimal development and satisfaction of individual needs and faculties with a minimum of toil and misery?

- its sweeping rationality, which propels efficiency and growth, is itself irrational. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=538))
- The fact that the vast majority of the population accepts, and is made to accept, this society does not render it less irrational and less reprehensible. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=539))
- The distinction between true and false consciousness, real and immediate interest still is meaningful. But this distinction itself must be validated. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=540))
- Confronted with the total character of the achievements of advanced industrial society, critical theory is left without the rationale for transcending this society. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=545))
- The vacuum empties the theoretical structure itself, because the categories of a critical social theory were developed during the period in which the need for refusal and subversion was embodied in the action of effective social forces. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=546))
    - Note: IL problema non é una lotta tra forze dentro il sistema. ma il problema é il sistema stesso che tutto assorbe. Quesot fu il mantra del '68
- The category “society” itself expressed the acute conflict between the social and political sphere—society as antagonistic to the state. Similarly, “individual,” “class,” “private,” “family” denoted spheres and forces not yet integrated with the established conditions—spheres of tension and contradiction. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=548))
- Modern industrial society is the pervasive identity of these opposites—it is the whole that is in question. At the same time, the position of theory cannot be one of mere speculation. It must be a historical position in the sense that it must be grounded on the capabilities of the given society. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=556))
- One-Dimensional Man will vacillate throughout between two contradictory hypotheses: (1) that advanced industrial society is capable of containing qualitative change for the foreseeable future; (2) that forces and tendencies ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=559))
- exist which may break this containment and explode the society. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=560))
- In this society, the productive apparatus tends to become totalitarian to the extent to which it determines not only the socially needed occupations, skills, and attitudes, but also individual needs and aspirations. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=567))
- The totalitarian tendency of these controls seems to assert itself in still another sense—by spreading to the less developed and even to the pre-industrial areas of the world, and by creating similarities in the development of capitalism and communism. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=570))
    - Note: This is important for Migration Studies
- Technology as such cannot be isolated from the use to which it is put; the technological society is a system of domination which operates already in the concept and construction of techniques. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=573))
- As a technological universe, advanced industrial society is a political universe, the latest stage in the realization of a specific historical project—namely, the experience, transformation, and organization of nature as the mere stuff of domination. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=579))
- Freedom of thought, speech, and conscience were—just as free enterprise, which they served to promote and protect—essentially critical ideas, designed to replace an obsolescent material and intellectual culture by a more productive and rational one. Once institutionalized, these rights and liberties shared the fate of the society of which they had become an integral part. The achievement cancels the premises. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=614))
- Under the conditions of a rising standard of living, non-conformity with the system itself appears to be socially useless, and the more so when it entails tangible economic and political disadvantages and threatens the smooth operation of the whole. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=622))
- Freedom of enterprise was from the beginning not altogether a blessing. As the liberty to work or to starve, it spelled toil, insecurity, and fear for the vast majority of the population. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=626))
- If the individual were no longer compelled to prove himself on the market, as a free economic subject, the disappearance of this kind of freedom would be one of the greatest achievements of civilization. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=627))

- The very structure of human existence would be altered; the individual would be liberated from the work world’s imposing upon him alien needs and alien possibilities. The individual would be free to exert autonomy over a life that would be his own. If the productive apparatus could be organized and directed toward the satisfaction of the vital needs, its control might well be centralized; such control would not prevent individual autonomy, but render it possible. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=630))
- By virtue of the way it has organized its technological base, contemporary industrial society tends to be totalitarian. For “totalitarian” is not only a terroristic political coordination of society, but also a nonterroristic economic-technical coordination which operates through the manipulation of needs by vested interests. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=635))
- But the political trend may be reversed; essentially the power of the machine is only the stored-up and projected power of man. To the extent to which the work world is conceived of as a machine and mechanized accordingly, it becomes the potential basis of a new freedom for man. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=646))
- Contemporary industrial civilization demonstrates that it has reached the stage at which “the free society” can no longer be adequately defined in the traditional terms of economic, political, and intellectual liberties, not because these liberties have become insignificant, but because they are too significant ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=648))
- Thus economic freedom would mean freedom from the economy—from being controlled by economic forces and relationships; freedom from the daily struggle for existence, from earning a living. Political freedom would mean liberation of the individuals from politics over which they have no effective control. Similarly, intellectual freedom would mean the restoration of individual thought now absorbed by mass communication and indoctrination, abolition of “public opinion” together with its makers. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=652))
- The intensity, the satisfaction and even the character of human needs, beyond the biological level, have always been preconditioned. Whether or not the possibility of doing or leaving, enjoying or destroying, possessing or rejecting something is seized as a need depends on whether or not it can be seen as desirable and necessary for the prevailing societal institutions and interests. In this sense, human needs are historical needs and, to the extent to which the society demands the repressive development of the individual, his needs themselves and their claim for satisfaction are subject to overriding critical standards. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005JT1TNE&location=658))
- We may distinguish both true and false needs. “False” are those which are superimposed upon the individual by particular social interests in his repression: the needs which perpetuate toil, aggressiveness, misery, and injustice.

- All liberation depends on the consciousness of servitude, and the emergence of this consciousness is always hampered by the predominance of needs and satisfactions which, to a great extent, have become the individual’s own. The process always replaces one system of preconditioning by another; the optimal goal is the replacement of false needs by true ones, the abandonment of repressive satisfaction.

- them. The objection misses the point. The preconditioning does not start with the mass production of radio and television and with the centralization of their control. The people enter this stage as preconditioned receptacles of long standing; the decisive difference is in the flattening out of the contrast (or conflict) between the given and the possible, between the satisfied and the unsatisfied needs.

- The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment. The very mechanism which ties the individual to his society has changed, and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced.

- “Progress” is not a neutral term; it moves toward specific ends, and these ends are defined by the possibilities of ameliorating the human condition. Advanced industrial society is approaching the stage where continued progress would demand the radical subversion of the prevailing direction and organization of progress. This stage would be reached when material production (including the necessary services) becomes automated to the extent that all vital needs can be satisfied while necessary labor time is reduced to marginal time.

- technical progress would transcend the realm of necessity, where it served as the instrument of domination and exploitation which thereby limited its rationality; technology would become subject to the free play of faculties in the struggle for the pacification of nature and of society.

- Such a state is envisioned in Marx’s notion of the “abolition of labor.” The term “pacification of existence” seems better suited to designate the historical alternative of a world which—through an international conflict which transforms and suspends the contradictions within the established societies—advances on the brink of a global war.
