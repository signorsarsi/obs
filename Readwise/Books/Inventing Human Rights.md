- Human rights require three interlocking qualities: rights must be natural (inherent in human beings); equal (the same for everyone); and universal (applicable everywhere). For ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001P7GGRI&location=167))

- The ambiguity of human rights was captured by the French Calvinist pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne, who wrote to the French king in 1787 to complain about the limitations of a proposed Edict of Toleration for Protestants like himself.

- acceptable." In 1755, the influential French Enlightenment writer Denis Diderot had written of droit naturel that "the use of this term is so familiar that there is almost no one who would not be convinced inside himself that the thing is obviously known to him.

- Even the austere Swiss natural law philosopher Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui insisted that liberty could only be proved by each man's inner feelings: "Such proofs of feeling are above all objection and produce the most deep-seated conviction."

- Two related but distinct qualities were involved: the ability to reason and the independence to decide for oneself. Both had to be present if an individual was to be morally autonomous. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001P7GGRI&location=267))

- fashion. Human rights depend both on self-possession and on the recognition that all others are equally self-possessed. It is the incomplete development of the latter that gives rise to all the inequalities of rights that have preoccupied us throughout all history.

- My argument depends on the notion that reading accounts of torture or epistolary novels had physical effects that translated into brain changes and came back out as new concepts about the organization of social and political life. New kinds of reading (and viewing and listening) created new individual experiences (empathy), which in turn made possible new social and political concepts (human rights).

- I believe that social and political change—in this case, human rights—comes about because many individuals had similar experiences, not because they all inhabited the same social context but because through their interactions with each other and with their reading and viewing, they actually created a new social context.

- Courtiers, clergy, military officers, and all manner of ordinary people wrote to Rousseau to describe their feelings of a "devouring fire," their "emotions upon emotions, upheavals upon upheavals." One recounted that he had not cried over Julie's death, but rather was "shrieking, howling like an animal." ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001P7GGRI&location=374))

- Novels made the point that all people are fundamentally similar because of their inner feelings, and many novels showcased in particular the desire for autonomy. In ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001P7GGRI&location=393))
