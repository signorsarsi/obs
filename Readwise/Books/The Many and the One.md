## Highlights
- The notion of participation (methexis) goes back at least to Plato, who used the term to explain how multiple particular things can be predicated of the same name.6 ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=476))

- Because participation involves both unity and plurality, it is essentially a theory about the relation between the One and the Many. In technical terms, “‘participation’ signifies the fundamental relationship of both structure and dependence in the dialectic of the many in relation to the One and of the different in relation to the Identical.” ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=479))

- In Christian contexts, participation describes the way in which creatures relate to the Creator and the way in which human beings share the divine life. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=482))

- The two kinds of participation have been recognized by the Church Fathers as “weak participation” and “strong participation,” which is also called “deification.”8 ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=483))

- Athanasius writes: That what came into being might not only be, but be good, it pleased God that his own Wisdom should condescend to the creatures, so as to introduce an impress and semblance of its image on all in common and on each, that what was made might be manifestly wise works and worthy of God.10 ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=488))

- The idea of participation also played a crucial role in Irenaeus’s thought, especially in his refutation of Gnosticism.11 On the one hand, participation rooted in the doctrine of creation enabled him to maintain the ontological distinction between God and creatures, refuting the Gnostic claim that human souls were divine. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=491))

- For Irenaeus, the truths of both creation and deification were captured by the concept of participation. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=496))

- Like the Church Fathers before him, Augustine used the notion of participation extensively in his writings.14 There are three kinds of participation in his thought, namely ontological participation, epistemological participation, and deification. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=497))

- The second type has to do with how the human mind is illumined by the light of God. The third kind is deification, through which humanity receives eternal qualities from God. In distinction from deification, the first two kinds of participation, namely ontological and epistemological, can be grouped under the category of metaphysical participation, which will be the focus of this book.

- Socrates’s answer contains three factors: the first is the transcendent Form of beauty, a perfect, underived essence; the second, the immanent form of beauty in the sensible thing; and the third, the thing that receives the immanent form of beauty. In a similar fashion, Augustine uses the three-factor theory of participation to describe the relation between creatures and God in De Moribus Manichaeorum, ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=509))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- “Everything that is true is true by reason of the truth.”21 There, he distinguishes between what is true (verum) and the truth itself (veritas): while verum cannot be true on its own but becomes true only by reason of veritas and thus depends on veritas, veritas is true in itself and depends on nothing else. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=521))

- For instance, he states that the human soul receives intellectual light by participation in the divine light. God is the One “who makes the rational and intellectual soul, of which kind is that of human beings, blessed by participation in His unchangeable and incorporeal light.” ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=569))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- Augustine in the process of combating Manichaeism develops a unique metaphysic of being, namely the identification of being with goodness, which has far-reaching impacts for Christian thought.47 In Plato, goodness is beyond being, as he asserts that “goodness itself is not essence but still transcends essence in dignity and surpassing power.”48 ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=674))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Likewise, Neoplatonism places the Good above being. On this point, Augustine clearly departs from the Platonic tradition. For him, goodness must be ultimately identical to being, for God, who is “the Good,” is at the same time the Creator of all that is—“Being itself.”49 ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=677))

- As discussed above, Augustine essentially borrows the three-factor structure of participation from Plato: the Form or underived source of perfection, the participating subject that receives the limited perfection, and the limited perfection that exists immanently in the subject. As the Platonic insight was further developed by Plotinus, it became a core principle in Neoplatonic philosophy—the idea of a first principle with an unlimited capacity to diffuse its goodness in limited fashion to the whole of reality—which, as Norris Clarke observes, “was passed down to the medieval Christian thinkers, in varying degrees of explicitness, clarity, and adaptation to the Christian view of the universe.”54 ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=701))

- 1. Augustine transforms the Platonic conception of the One—the nature of unity. Within the Platonic tradition, Neoplatonism is especially known for its elevation of the One above Being, as Plotinus repeatedly stresses that the One cannot be named because it transcends Being. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=717))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- 3. Perhaps, the most significant change Augustine brings to the theory of participation is the relationship between the One and the Many. While in both Plato and Plotinus an insoluble tension exists between the transcendence and immanence of the One in relation to the Many, Augustine is able to resolve the conflict and harmonize the two. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=727))
- A defining feature of Neoplatonic metaphysics is to place the One or the Good above Being.62 For instance, Plato asserts that “the good itself is not essence but still transcends essence in dignity and surpassing power.” ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=741))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Plotinus affirms that the One is beyond Being, since the One cannot be named “except that it may be described as transcending Being.” ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=743))

- [T]he more they have being, and the more good they do—the more, that is, they effect—the more they have efficient causes. On the other hand, insofar as they lack being, and for this reason do evil—for what, in this case, do they achieve but emptiness?—they have deficient causes.86 ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=826))

- 2. In contrast to the Neoplatonic tendency to devalue multiplicity, Augustine’s metaphysics of participation stresses the goodness of multiple creatures and the nonexistence of evil. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=721))
- Also following Plotinus, in Confessions he defines sin as falling away the One, which results in the soul being distracted by multiplicity. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=737))
- than Being, for God has declared to be Being Himself in the Scripture (Exodus 3:14) and the Creator who bestows existence to all things. In the light of the biblical revelation, Augustine is compelled to assert that Being is the highest principle and repeatedly refers to God as “Being” and “He Who supremely is.” ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=747))
    - Note: Dio é l'essere supremo, ma é un essere profondamente trascendente sé stesso.
- In fact, those who ask such questions fail to understand Plotinus’s concept of the One in relation to Being. To ask such questions, they think within the Christian framework, where beings emanate from Being. However, as we have stressed, for Plotinus, the One is beyond Being and as such the reality of one thing is not determined by its being but by its relation to the One. Accordingly, just as there is a reality, namely the One, that is above Being, there must be a reality that is below Being at the other end of the spectrum. In other words, just as the One is not Being but nonetheless real, Absolute Evil—the opposite of the One—is likewise not being but have real existence too.89 In a system where the One is more fundamental than Being, it is natural to posit the reality of Absolute Evil outside the realm of Being. But what is the Absolute Evil? Plotinus identifies it as Matter, the “Undetermination-Absolute, some Absolute Formlesss,” which is entirely “below all the patterns, forms, shapes, measurements and limits.”90 In identifying matter as absolute chaos and evil, Plotinus believes in the existence of absolute multiplicity that is totally deprived of all Forms, order or unity. Multiplicity is the ultimate source of evil. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=846))

    - Note: NOn sembra corretto. L'essere indeterminato e senza forma non implica la molteplicitá.
- Other things may be said to be like unity in so far as they have being, and in so far as they are true. . . . Since things are true in so far as they have being, and have being in so far they resemble the source of all unity, that is, the Form of all things that have being.91 ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=862))
    - Note: Unitá implica una relazione. COse irrelate non sono unitarie. L'unitá del tutto dipemea dalla relazione del tutto. Perche´nella relazione ogni correlato partecipa della funzione del tutto.
      D'altra parte la molteplicitá é gia nelle unitá correlate. Se il loro relazionarsi 'e di un'unica forma la struttura é molto semplice. Se ci sono comportamenti multipli in ognui unitá quets aimplica una macrostruttura unitaria ma complessa. Oppure possono avere un comportamente semplice, ma se esiste una grande differenza negli enti correlati il comportamente é complesso.
- Being and Unity, a creature participates in God and has being and unity, which fall short of God’s full Being and Unity. Participation is a creature’s necessary relation to God, through which it receives limited unity from God: Every corporeal thing is a true body but a false unity. For it is not supremely one and does not completely imitate unity. And yet it would not be a body either if it did not have some unity. Besides it could have no unity unless it derived it from supreme unity.92 Since anything that exists has a degree ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=869))

- In this respect, then, Augustine is decisively at odds with Plotinus, although he is indebted to the latter in many ways. While Plotinus posits the existence of Absolute Evil or absolute multiplicity as contrary to the One, Augustine argues that there is nothing that is directly contrary to the One or Being. By identifying unity with being, Augustine makes a significant modification on a crucial aspect of Plotinus’s metaphysics.

- One of the direct consequences of identifying unity with being is Augustine’s idea of divine simplicity, which, as we will see, has a decisive influence on Aquinas. The logic is straightforward: since unity is equivalent to being, God, the Supreme Being, must be supremely unified, or in other words, absolutely simple. The notion of divine simplicity is a crucial theme in Augustine’s thought, especially in his later works. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=902))
- It is for this reason, then, that the nature of the Trinity is called simple, because it has not anything that it can lose, and because it is not something different from what it has, in a way that a vessel is different from its liquid or a body from its colour or the air from its light or heat, or the mind from its wisdom. For none of these things is what it has: the vessel is not liquid; the body is not colour; the air is not light or heat; the mind is not wisdom.100 ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=913))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- In Augustine’s thought, there is no distinction between substance and accidents in a simple being, since “what it is” (substance) and “what it has” (accidents) become indistinguishable. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=920))
- For in the human soul to be is not the same as to be strong, or prudent, or just, or temperate, for there can be a soul without any of these virtues. But for God to be is the same as to be strong, or to be just, or to be wise, and to be whatever else you may say of that simple multiplicity, or that multiple simplicity, whereby His substance is signified.103 ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=930))
- In other words, God’s substance is identical to his qualities. Divine simplicity means no ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=935))
- Since, therefore, the Father alone, or the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone is just as great as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together, He is not be called threefold in any sense. Bodies, on the contrary, increase by a union of themselves. . . . God does not thereby become greater than each one separately, for there is nothing whereby that perfection can increase.105 ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=943))
- themselves. In Augustine, God “the One”—the ultimate unifying principle of all of reality—is truly and absolutely unified in himself, which pushes metaphysics toward a new level of unity. All things are now unified by the absolutely simple God. In addition, such a Unity is truly comprehensive and all-embracing, for even matter, which is outside the realm of unity in Plato’s thought, now falls under the unifying effect of the Augustinian One, God, who created matter out of nothing. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=948))
- More importantly, this all-unifying One in its simplicity is not mere negation or deprivation of multiplicity. On the contrary, the One is infinitely rich and active, as the One is the Supreme Being that possesses all the qualities of being in infinite eminence and plenitude. Only this One, who is Being Itself, avoids the aloofness of the Plotinian One and relates to the Many in a profoundly intimate fashion. The One does not compromise but sustains the integrity and substantiality of the Many. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=953))
- According to this, therefore, those things which are fundamentally and truly divine are called simple, because in them quality and substance are one and the same, and because they are divine, or wise, or blessed without participation in anything which is not themselves.5 ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1208))
    - Note: Citazione di Agostino: La sostanza e le qualita' sono la stessa cosa :non ci sono accidenti.
- Thus, for Augustine, it is not multiplicity but idolatry—making creatures rather than God our ultimate concern—that is at the heart of sin. Multiplicity in creation is good in itself, but if we choose to enjoy it for its own sake instead of God, we commit sin and produce evil. For this reason, Augustine emphasizes that God alone is to be enjoyed, whereas creatures are to be used. It is out of the same concern that he admonishes the soul not to look for creaturely multiplicity but turn to God. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1388))

- In this sense, multiplicity in Augustine’s thought can be seen as a transcendental,38 which, as we shall see, is later made more explicit by Aquinas.39 ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1394))
- On this understanding, multiplicity is not merely creaturely finitude, but first exists supremely within God. Divine multiplicity is the source of creaturely multiplicity. Needless to say, no ontological continuity exists between divine and created multiplicity and yet the doctrine of creation requires a correspondence and causal relation between them, just as there is a correspondence and causal relationship between divine and human wisdom.

- 41 Just as Augustine states that evil is nothing but “the absence of good,”42 Plotinus regards multiplicity as nothing but the absence of unity and goodness. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1408))

- On this understanding, matter is blamed as the cause of wickedness.50 To be sure, in Neoplatonism matter is not identical to corporeal things such as the world and the human body.51 ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1436))

- But the philosophers . . . mock us because we say that the separation of soul and body is to be considered among its punishments. They do so because they deem that the soul’s blessedness is perfected only when it is entirely rid of the body, and returns to God simple and alone and, as it were, naked.55 ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1445))

- Augustine argues that it is not the body but the corruptibility of the body that is responsible for the vices of the soul. The question remains, however—what causes the body’s corruptibility? ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1484))

- Now someone may say that the flesh is the cause of moral evils of every kind, because it is thanks to the influences of the flesh that the soul lives as it does. But he who says this has not considered the whole nature of man with sufficient care…. Nonetheless, those who suppose that the ills of the soul derive from the body are in error.62 ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1494))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Augustine asserts firmly: Our faith, however, is something very different. For the corruption of the body, which presseth down the soul, was not the cause of the first sin, but its punishment; nor was it corruptible flesh that made the soul sinful, but the sinful soul that made the flesh corruptible.63 ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1498))

- Augustine’s strategy is reductio ad absurdum: if we were to concede to our adversaries that all vices are caused by the flesh, a logical conclusion would be that Satan is completely without sin, because he does not have a body. But this is absurd according to what we know from revelation and hence the assumption that the flesh is the cause of evil is false. With this argument, Augustine reaffirms the Christian position that the source of evil is not the body but the soul: ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1509))

- For when this world passes away, this will not come about by the utter destruction of things, but by their transformation. This is why the apostle says, “For the figure of this world passeth away. I would have you be without anxiety.” It is, then, the figure, not the nature, that passeth away.72 ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1555))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The same understanding applies to the relationship between nature and evil. For Augustine, created natures are substances, while evil is an accident that is not caused by a nature but something external to the nature. Because nature is substantial, evil must be non-substantial. For this reason, he is emphatic about the non-substantiality of evil.75 With the distinction between substance and accidents, Augustine develops a unique understanding of nature’s relation to evil. Because nature is substantial to something and evil is accidental to it, nature cannot be the cause of evil. Evil does not arise within nature; it arises outside of nature.

- Greek philosophy began with the recognition of transcendence, without which there would be no philosophy. When pre-Socratic philosophers such as Thales and Anaximander asked, “What is the fundamental stuff out of which things are made?” they assumed the existence of a single first cause beneath the manifold of things. This ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1867))

- While Greek philosophy is a departure from Greek mythology, it is profoundly influenced by the latter. The first cause is often identified as god or some sort of deity2 and the relation between divinity and the world is a central problem in Greek philosophy. In her important study, Kathryn Tanner offers a taxonomy of Greek concepts of divinity’s relation with the world. The first type, namely “univocal predication,” perceives divinity as “a kind of being distinct from others within the matrix of the same cosmos.”3 Divinity is then “that which is most powerful, self-sufficient and unchanging among beings.”4 ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1873))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- The tension between divinity’s transcendence and immanence is even sharper in the second type of relation. This type of relation places deity or Ideas in direct opposition to the visible world, as is represented by Plato’s theory of the two worlds. “The Being of knowable Ideas is simply contrasted with the physical world of Becoming apprehended in sense perception and opinion.”5 Whereas sensible things in the world change and perish, the Ideas exist perfectly and permanently. In this type of relation, divinity’s difference and transcendence from the world is more prominent, but its immanence is severely limited such that it is often conceived as utterly detached from the world. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1883))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Likewise, Aristotle’s unmoved Mover is utterly indifferent to the world. As the final cause of the world, the Aristotelian God thinks only of his own thoughts and is completely isolated from the world. In such contrastive conceptions, transcendence is achieved at the expense of immanence. To secure his difference from the world, God is distanced from the world. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1888))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- There is a third kind of relation that proposes “a radical transcendence of God that is non-contrastive,” which goes beyond the first two kinds. While univocal predication assumes God’s continuity with the world,7 direct opposition is also appropriate only “for distinguishing beings within the world.” But “if God transcends the world, God must transcend that sort of characterization, too.”8 Plotinus seems to have this transcendence in view when he speaks of the One that is simple and unnamable. The One is beyond everything and is thus unspeakable and unknowable. In addition, as the source of everything, in which all things participate, the One is considered present to all things.9 The One is thus at once transcendent and immanent in relation to the world. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1893))
- The transcendence of God is key to Augustine’s thought and permeates his writings. He treats of this topic in many places, but one of his most concentrated discussions of God’s transcendent nature is found in the Confessions. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1916))

- The ontological gap between God and the mind, however, does not mean that God is removed or detached from the mind. As such, after stating that God transcends his mind “not in a way that oil floats on water,” Augustine immediately adds that nor does God transcend “as heaven is above earth.”18 If “heaven” here refers to the sky, the distance between heaven and earth would be spatial. Then to say that God is not above his mind as heaven is above earth, Augustine seems to emphasize that the distance between God and his mind is not spatial,19 nor in the same ontological spectrum. But for Augustine “heaven” often means the spiritual realm in contrast to the physical world,20 and as such the statement above would mean that the ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1954))
- transcendence. The most pivotal foundation for his concept of transcendence, however, is not Neoplatonism but the Christian doctrine of creatio ex nihilo. Although much of Augustine’s language in Confessions has Neoplatonic traces, the fundamental theme in his concept of transcendence, as Harrison suggests, is not, in fact, strictly a Platonic one: it is the conviction that God is Being, to whom all other beings owe their existence, and that there is an ontological divide between creation and Creator; creation is brought into being out of nothing and is mutable and temporal, whereas God is the transcendent, eternal and immutable Creator on whom all else depends.21 ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1971))

- The ultimate difference in reality is therefore not the difference between two things in the physical realm or between the spirit and the matter, but the difference between the Maker and what is made. The difference between God and the world cannot be contrastive, because the Creator is not the negation of creation but the infinite source of all things—the Being Itself. This understanding is made clear in Augustine’s description of God in the Ostia vision: ([Location 1984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1984))

- Here, not only does Augustine confirm that God transcends corporeal things and the mind; he also explicitly asserts that God’s transcendence is rooted in the fact that he is the Creator, which means that the foundation of his concept of transcendence is not Neoplatonism but the doctrine of creation.

- Even if Plotinus’s metaphysics may be called “creationist” in a certain sense,25 the emanations are not intentional products but overflows out of the One.26 ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=1998))

- participate. All things participate God, who freely brought them into being from nothing. No ontic continuity exists between God and creation, because “all things were made not of the very substance of God but out of nothing.”31 ([Location 2037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2037))

- Augustine realizes that when he calls upon God, he is essentially asking God to come “into” him. But the immediate dilemma is: how can a creature contain God, when even heaven and earth cannot contain him? How can what is infinite enter into what is finite? Recognizing the infinity of God, Augustine is stressing the radical transcendence of God over creation. On the other hand, in a paradoxical fashion, he confesses that the Creator must be already “within” him, for unless God is already intimately present to him, he would not exist at all. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2097))

- Hence for Augustine, God’s radical transcendence must go hand in hand with his radical immanence. He realizes that, as the Creator who creates all things out of nothing and sustains their existence, God must be at once transcendent and immanent. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2104))
- But in Augustine, immanence is two-directional. Not only is God “within” the creature; the latter also exists “in” God: “I would have no being if I were not in you . . . in whom are all things. . . . How can I tell you to come to me if I am already in you?” The Many is immanent to the One, just as the One is immanent to the Many. Such a conception of immanence is decisively un-Plotinian.

- Although the Divine Being is beyond words and cannot be spoken of in any way with human language without recourse to expressions of time and place, whereas God is before all time and all place, nevertheless He who made us is nearer to us than many things which have been made. For in him we live and move and have being.45 ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2164))

- Like Augustine, Aquinas makes the doctrine of creation entirely foundational to his system of thought.1 But he surpasses his predecessor by developing a true metaphysic of creation, which enables him not only to conceptualize and articulate the meaning of creation more precisely but to construct a more distinctively Christian participatory ontology, which can be more conducive to the contemporary retrieval of participatory theology. ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2404))
- One of Avicenna’s main contributions is his definition of creation as “making something after absolute non-existence.” ([Location 2442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2442))

- For Avicenna, as for most Neoplatonic thinkers before him, essence is more fundamental than existence, which is an accident that happens to the essence. In contrast, by defining existence as the act of essence,15 Aquinas makes existence more fundamental. In the history of metaphysics, if Avicenna can be referred as an “essentialist,” Aquinas is then an “existentialist,”16 for in Aquinas existence is more primary than essence. This shift is profound. As Burrell puts it, Aquinas’s metaphysics is “more than a development of Avicenna; it is a fresh start requiring a conception of existing that could no longer be confused with an accident.”17 ([Location 2455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2455))
- 21 For him, it is impossible for something to come from nothing, a conclusion that he claims is accepted by all philosophers.22 For it is taken for granted by Aristotle and Greek philosophers that pre-existing primary matter serves as the material cause of the world. Aquinas, however, has to disagree with the Philosopher on this point. He insists that there is no material cause for creation, because even matter itself must ultimately have been created by God. Prime matter is not pre-existent or self-existent but was brought into being from nothing. Hence, while embracing Aristotle’s idea of material cause, he arrives at an entirely different conclusion—that the Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo is not only rational but also the summit of philosophy. Past philosophers failed to recognize the truth of creation, he suggests, because their thought did not reach the level of metaphysics and hence were unable to arrive at the metaphysical concept of creation.23 For this reason, Aquinas’s first task is to provide a metaphysical definition of creation and here he goes considerably beyond Augustine.

- An even clearer definition of creation is given in Summa theologiae, where Aquinas explicitly states that “to create is to make something out of nothing”: [I]t is not enough to consider how some particular being issues from some particular cause, for we should also attend to the issuing of the whole of being from the universal cause, which is God; it is this springing forth that we designate by the term “creation.”25 ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2502))

- Creatures therefore cannot exist on their own, since nothing in their nature contains the source for their existence—existence comes from without. They must continually depend upon God. Creation is thus not a onetime event but an ongoing relation to God. At the heart of the doctrine of creation is thus the radical ontological dependence of creatures on God. They depend on God not only for their coming into being but also for their continuing to ([Location 2531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2531))

- exist. For this reason, Aquinas suggests that creation and conservation are essentially one operation: God does not produce things into being by one operation and conserve them in being by another. . . . Whence the operation of God does not differ according as it makes the beginning of being and as it makes the continuation of being.

- If creation describes the way in which the One produces the Many, participation explains the way in which the Many relate to the One. As such, Aquinas’s theology of participation is the reverse side of his metaphysic of creation. Having discussed his metaphysic of creation, we now examine his metaphysics of participation. We first need to clarify what the term “participation” means for Aquinas. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2554))

- The concept of participation (methexis) goes back at least to Plato, who employed this term to describe how different individual things can be called by the same name.33 For instance, there are different flowers such as rose, orchid, and lily, but they all are called “flowers.” In other words, they share the same name “flower” and in a more technical language we say that they participate in “flower.” Participation thus accounts for the relation between the One and the Many. In addition to the Platonic heritage, Aquinas adds the Aristotelian theory of causality to participation, making it more dynamic. To participate, he says, “is nothing other than to receive partially from another.” ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2557))

- In this crucial passage, all the key themes of our discussion—participation,38 the One and the Many, causality and creation—are deeply interwoven. The goal of this argument is to prove that God is the single cause of existence for all things. But the backbone of the whole argument is the concept of participation, the essence of which is the causal relationship between the One (which possesses a reality fully and by nature) and the Many (which possess the reality partially). Aquinas first establishes the general rule of participation that a partial reality found in a thing must come from something that possesses the reality by nature. Applying the rule to existence, he then reasons that all things that exist partially must receive existence from something that exists by nature, which is God. Hence, God alone is the source of existence for all things. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2597))

- When the relation is between what is partial and what is full, participation is ontological or causal and is suitable for describing the relationship between a cause and its effect. This kind of participation, which is most important in Aquinas, is associated with causality. For instance, when we say that air participates in the sun’s light, we mean that air receives partial light from the sun. Integrating Plato’s idea of participation with Aristotle’s causality, this ([Location 2577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B092SZSQ2W&location=2577))
