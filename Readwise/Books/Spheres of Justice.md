## Highlights
- How is that group constituted? I don’t mean, How was it constituted? I am concerned here not with the historical origins of the different groups, but with the decisions they make in the present about their present and future populations. The primary good that we distribute to one another is membership in some human community. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=739))

- Men and women without membership anywhere are stateless persons. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=744))

- Whom should we admit? Ought we to have open admissions? Can we choose among applicants? What are the appropriate criteria for distributing membership? ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=754))

- The philosophical grounds of the principle are hard to specify (its history provides its practical ground). I doubt that Rawls is right to argue that we can establish it simply by imagining “what a society would be like if this duty were rejected”2— ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=769))
- Governor John Winthrop, arguing against free immigration to the new Puritan commonwealth of Massachusetts, insisted that this right of refusal applies also to collective mutual aid: “As for hospitality, that rule does not bind further than for some present occasion, not for continual residence.”3 ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=781))
- Consider, then, three possible analogues for the political community: we can think of countries as neighborhoods, clubs, or families. The list is obviously not exhaustive, but it will serve to illuminate certain key features of admission and exclusion. Schools, bureaucracies, and companies, though they have some of the characteristics of clubs, distribute social and economic status as well as membership; I will take them ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSEQMFO&location=827))
