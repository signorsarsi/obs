## Highlights
- We can see nested distinctions at work in Pecham's trinitarian theology in a second "flashpoint" between the two trinitarian traditions and their different understanding of the trinitarian properties.
  This flashpoint concerns the issue of the Son's role in the spiration of the Holy Spirit (see the Appendix: element c). The issue is as follows: would the Son and the Holy Spirit still be distinct from each other if they each emanated from the Father alone, as the Franciscans maintained they would; or are the Son and the Holy Spirit distinct only if the Holy Spirit proceeds from


- most basic trinitarian fact. In particular, I discuss a theory that appeals to the Aristotelian category of relation to explain personal distinction and essential identity. From Thomas Aquinas (†1274) and on, most Dominican theologians held a version of this theory, which I call the "relation account" of personal distinction. I also discuss a rival theory that, in order to explain identity and distinction, appeals to emanation, that is to say the way that the divine persons are put into being or originated. This "emanation account" of personal distinction is closely related to the Aristotelian categories of action and passion, and, as we will see, following a tendency in Bonaventure's (†1274) thought, most Franciscan theologians adhered to this view. Significantly, the confrontation between the respective adherents of each of these two major views drives many of the most important developments in late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century trinitarian thought. For this reason, this chapter really sets the stage for the rest of the book.
