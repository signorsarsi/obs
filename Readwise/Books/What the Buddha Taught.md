## Highlights
- This is true not only in intellectual and spiritual matters, but also in human relations. When, for instance, we meet a man, we do not look on him as a human being, but we put a label on him, such as English, French, German, American, or Jew, and regard him with all the prejudices associated with that label in our mind. Yet he may be completely free from those attributes which we have put on him. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=287))

- ‘In the same manner, O bhikkhus, I have taught a doctrine similar to a raft—it is for crossing over, and not for carrying (lit. getting hold of). ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=389))

- that the term dukkha in the First Noble Truth contains, quite obviously, the ordinary meaning of ‘suffering’, but in addition it also includes deeper ideas such as ‘imperfection’, ‘impermanence’, ‘emptiness’, ‘insubstantiality’. It is difficult therefore to find one word to embrace the whole conception of the term dukkha as the First Noble Truth, and so it is better to leave it untranslated, than to give an inadequate and wrong idea of it by conveniently translating it as ‘suffering’ or ‘pain’.

- is free from sensations both pleasant (sukha) and unpleasant (dukkha) and is only pure equanimity and awareness—even these very high spiritual states are included in dukkha. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=497))

- The conception of dukkha may be viewed from three aspects: (1) dukkha as ordinary suffering (dukkha-dukkha), (2) dukkha as produced by change (vipariṇāma-dukkha) and (3) dukkha as conditioned states (saṃkhāra-dukkha).2 ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=527))

- ‘Consciousness may exist having matter as its means (rūpupāyaṃ), matter as its object (rūpārammaṇaṃ), matter as its support (rūpa-patiṭṭhaṃ), and seeking delight it may grow, increase and develop; or consciousness may exist having sensation as its means ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=629))

- ‘O Brāhmaṇa, it is just like a mountain river, flowing far and swift, taking everything along with it; there is no moment, no instant, no second when it stops flowing, but it goes on flowing and continuing. So Brāhmaṇa, is human life, like a mountain river.’1 As the Buddha told Raṭṭhapāla: “The world is in continuous flux and is impermanent.’ ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=642))
- One of the principal evils in life, according to Buddhism, is ‘repugnance’ or hatred. Repugnance (pratigha) is explained as ‘ill-will with regard to living beings, with regard to suffering and with regard to things pertaining to suffering. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=681))
- There are two ancient Buddhist texts called the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā which are full of the joyful utterances of the Buddha’s disciples, both male and female, who found peace and happiness in life through his teaching.

- What in general is suggested by Soul, Self, Ego, or to use the Sanskrit expression Ātman, is that in man there is a permanent, everlasting and absolute entity, ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1135))
- This soul or self in man is the thinker of thoughts, feeler of sensations, and receiver of rewards and punishments for all its actions good and bad. Such a conception is called the idea of self. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1140))
- The doctrine of Anatta or No-Soul is the natural result of, or the corollary to, the analysis of the Five Aggregates and the teaching of Conditioned Genesis ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1162))

- This is how life arises, exists and continues. If we take this formula in its reverse order, we come to the cessation of the process: ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1203))

- The second reason is that the Buddha denied categorically, in unequivocal terms, in more than one place, the existence of Ātman, Soul, Self, or Ego within ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1258))

- ‘All conditioned things are impermanent’ (Sabbe SAMKHĀRĀ aniccā), and ‘All conditioned things are dukkha’ (Sabbe SAMKHĀR Ā;DUKKHā). The third verse says: ‘All dhammas are without self’ (Sabbe DHAMMĀ anattā).1 ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003OYIG00&location=1262))
