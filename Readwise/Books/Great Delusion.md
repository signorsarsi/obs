## Highlights
- Many in the West, especially among foreign policy elites, consider liberal hegemony a wise policy that states should axiomatically adopt. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=107))

- Spreading liberal democracy around the world is said to make eminently good sense from both a moral and a strategic perspective. For starters, it is thought to be an excellent way to protect human rights, which are sometimes seriously violated by authoritarian states. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=108))
- Liberalism oversells the importance of individual rights. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=145))

- Liberalism is also no match for realism. At its core, liberalism assumes that the individuals who make up any society sometimes have profound differences about what constitutes the good life, and these differences might lead them to try to kill each other.

- Thus a state is needed to keep the peace. But there is no world state to keep countries at bay when they have profound disagreements. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=147))

- The structure of the international system is anarchic, not hierarchic, which means that liberalism applied to international politics cannot work. Countries thus have little choice but to act according to balance-of-power logic if they hope to survive. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=148))

- My argument, stated briefly, is that nationalism and realism almost always trump liberalism. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=151))

- George W. Bush, who said in a speech in March 2003, two weeks before the invasion of Iraq: “The current Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and violence in the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions. America’s interests in security, and America’s belief in liberty, both lead in the same direction: to a free and peaceful Iraq.”5 Later that year, on September 6, he proclaimed: “The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it is the calling of our country. From the Fourteen Points to the Four Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put our power at the service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature; we believe that liberty is the direction of history. We believe that human fulfillment and excellence come in the responsible exercise of liberty. And we believe that freedom—the freedom we prize—is not for us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind.”6 ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=172))
- The United States has been at war for two out of every three years since 1989, fighting seven different wars. We should not be surprised by this. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in the West, a liberal foreign policy is not a formula for cooperation and peace but for instability and conflict. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=185))
- What is the “state all men are naturally in”? What distinguishing characteristics do all humans have in common? Answering this question is important not only for understanding liberalism but also for understanding nationalism and realism. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=206))

- We need to answer two principal questions about human nature. First, are men and women social beings above all else, or does it make more sense to emphasize their individuality? In other words, are humans fundamentally social animals who strive hard to carve out room for their individuality, or are they individuals who form social contracts? ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=210))

- Second, have our critical faculties developed to the point where we can reach some rough moral consensus on what defines the good life? Can we agree on first principles? ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=213))

- My view is that we are profoundly social beings from the start to the finish of our lives and that individualism is of secondary importance, which is not to say that it is unimportant. Second, it is impossible to reach a common understanding about first principles, even though there can be widespread agreement within different groups.

- Liberalism downplays the social nature of human beings to the point of almost ignoring it, instead treating people largely as atomistic actors. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=217))

- But liberals wisely emphasize that it is not possible to approach any universal agreement on questions relating to what constitutes the good life. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=218))
- Both nationalism and realism, meanwhile, are in sync with human nature, which explains not only why they trump liberalism when they are at odds with it but also why they are the main driving forces behind international politics. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=220))
- Nationalism and realism pay little attention to individuals and rights and instead see the world in terms of distinct nation-states, reflecting the fact that humans are principally social beings who have fundamentally different views of what constitutes the good life.8 ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=221))
- These differences notwithstanding, all three isms have one important feature in common: a profound concern about survival. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07H3XRPQS&location=224))

- Political liberalism, in my lexicon, is an ideology that is individualistic at its core and assigns great importance to the concept of inalienable rights.9 This concern for rights is the basis of its universalism—everyone on the planet has the same inherent set of rights—and this is what motivates liberal states to pursue ambitious foreign policies.
