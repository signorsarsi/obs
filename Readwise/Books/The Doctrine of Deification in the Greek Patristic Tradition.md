- ‘Becoming a god’ for Basil has no ontological implications. Those who arecalled to be gods, he says, are the perfect in virtue (Adv. Eun. 3. 5). This doesnot mean that they are ‘gods’ in any real sense. The word is used analogically:the foolish are called wise in Scripture, just as those who are not gods bynature are called gods (Hom. in Ps. 48. 6, PG 29. 445a). Words and realitiesdo not coincide. If that were so names and natures would be one and thesame. ‘Therefore since those who are perfect in virtue are deemed worthy ofthe title of god, men would be of the same nature (homoousioi) as the God ofthe universe. But this would be absurd’ (Adv. Eun. 2. 4).Nevertheless, even the titular or analogical deiﬁcation ([Location 97432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NKK6BA&location=97432))

- 80–4). We may also, I suggest, addfrom Hippolytus: ‘not being enslaved to desires or passions and moral diseases, you will enter into communion with God and become a fellow-heirwith Christ. For you have become a god’ (Lση δ; /µιλητ4 θεο κασυγκληρονµο Χριστο, ουκ πιθυµαι Z πα´θεσι κα νσοι δουλµενο.Γγονα γα`ρ θε) (Ref. 10. 34, GCS 3. 292–3).

- Hippolytus, in particular,seems much closer to Basil than does Plotinus. In Plotinus the soul is onlydiscovering its innate divinity, as the qualifying phrase indicates, whereas inHippolytus and Basil the soul becomes something it was not before, in theformer through conformity to Christ, in the latter through illumination bythe Spirit and the attainment of likeness to God.The manuscript tradition for the ascription of ([Location 98305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005NKK6BA&location=98305))
