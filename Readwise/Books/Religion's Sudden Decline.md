- Today, secularization is largely driven by the shift from pro-fertility norms to individual-choice norms. The two are closely linked. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QJFWKD1&location=341))
- Countries whose publics emphasize pro-fertility norms tend to be strongly religious, while countries whose publics emphasize individual-choice norms are much less religious. As one might expect, the publics of high-income countries rank highest on individual-choice norms, and—though they once were far more religious than the people of communist countries—today they are among the world’s least religious peoples. At the other end of the spectrum, the publics of Muslim-majority countries and low-income countries in Africa and Latin America are the world’s most religious people and adhere most strongly to pro-fertility norms.

- In contrast to the past, the publics of virtually all high-income countries now rank high on support for individual-choice norms and low on religiosity. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QJFWKD1&location=346))

- This reflects the fact that individual-choice norms and religiosity have a reciprocal causal connection. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QJFWKD1&location=347))

- Although intergenerational population replacement involves long time lags, cultural change can reach a tipping point at which new norms become dominant. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QJFWKD1&location=357))
- The shift from agrarian to industrial society brought a shift from traditional authority to rational bureaucratic authority, substituting political authority for religious authority. But in knowledge societies, authority has reached a point of diminishing acceptability. In recent decades, political leaders throughout the industrialized world have been experiencing some of the lowest levels of support ever recorded, opening the way for populist challenges. This is not simply because today’s leaders are less competent than previous leaders. It reflects a systematic decline in mass support for established political institutions.
