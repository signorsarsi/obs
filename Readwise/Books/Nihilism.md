## Highlights
- As opposed to Liberal vagueness, the Realist world-view seems perfectly clear and straightforward. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=466))
- No man, we have said often enough, lives without a god; who then—or what—is the god of the Nihilist? It is nihil, nothingness itself—not the nothingness of absence or non-existence, ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=995))
- but of apostasy and denial; it is the “corpse” of the “dead God” which so weighs upon the Nihilist. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=996))
- The artificial world erected by men who will to remove the last vestige of divine influence in the world, and the last trace of faith in men, promises to be so all-encompassing and so omnipresent that it will be all but impossible for men to see, to imagine, or even to hope for anything beyond it. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1127))
- a work of standardization, specialization, simplification, mechanization, dehumanization; its effect has been to “reduce” the individual to the most “primitive” and basic level, to make him in fact the slave of his environment, the perfect workman in Lenin’s worldwide “factory.” ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1160))

- this perfect Nihilism; but which nevertheless regards it as a necessary step, both logically ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1300))
- First, the corollary of the Nihilist annihilation of the Old Order is the conception of a “new age”—“new” in ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1312))
- inauguration of a whole new time; it is set up against all that has hitherto been. “It may be,” said Nietzsche in ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1313))
- Here there is already suggested the second corollary of Nihilist thought. The Nihilist rebellion and antitheism responsible for the “death of God” give rise to the idea that is to inaugurate the “new age”: the transformation of man himself into a god. “Dead are all the gods,” says Nietzsche’s Zarathustra: ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1321))
- Finally, the corollary of the Nihilist annihilation of authority and order is the conception—adumbrated in all the myths of a “new order”—of an entirely new species of order, an order which its most ardent defenders do not hesitate to call “Anarchy.” The Nihilist State, in the Marxist myth, is to “wither away,” leaving a world-order that is to be unique in human history, and which it would be no exaggeration to call the “millennium.” A “new age” ruled by “Anarchy” and populated by “Supermen”: this is the Revolutionary dream that has stirred men into performing the incredible drama of modern history.

- For most men today “life” is a small thing, a fleeting thing of small affirmation and small denial, veiled in comforting illusions and the hopeful prospect of ultimate nothingness; such men will know nothing of Hell until they live in it.

- owing his meaningless success to the fact that he, the emptiest of men, personified the emptiness of the men of his time. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LZ4JDVN&location=1473))
