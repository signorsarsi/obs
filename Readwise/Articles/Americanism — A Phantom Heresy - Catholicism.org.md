## Highlights
- According to Brother William Keifer, S.M., in his book *Leo XIII* , the above reference to *Testem Benevolentiae* referred to “the thoughts that he [Leo] had on the preface of the French version of the *Life of Father Hecker* . But he goes on to say, “Archbishop Ireland, who was in Rome at the time, wrote to the Holy Father, repudiating and condemning all the opinions which the apostolic letter repudiated and condemned. Later Gibbons also wrote to Leo on this matter. The letter stated that no educated American Catholic sided with *Americanism* . Corrigan and the German bishops still insisted *Americanism* did exist in the United States. Some have stated that the Pope was ill-advised, but if so, it was not for long.” In a footnote he says, “Cardinal Gibbons wrote Leo XIII, March 17, 1899, in part: ‘This doctrine, which I deliberately call extravagant and absurd, this *Americanism* , as it is called, has nothing in common with the views, aspirations, doctrines and conduct of Americans.’ Ellis, *The Life of James Cardinal Gibbons* , Vol. II, p. 71.”
