## Highlights
- But I think Covid is an example of how the intellectual narrowness of universities had real-world costs. Universities are where we have so many of our epidemiologists and our public health experts. That is one of those fields in which, when you survey the people in it, it leans extremely left. People in that field did a series of things during Covid that ended up being quite damaging and wrong. We still don’t know where Covid came from, but we certainly shouldn’t have been trying to chill debate about whether Covid came from a lab in China. They called for mask mandates, including on their own campuses but also in wider society, and it went on for months and months and months.
- Worst of all, a lot of these epidemiologists argued very strongly for keeping schools closed for months and months and months on end. They are a large part of the reason that schools in Democratic-run areas remained closed for a year or more in some cases, whereas schools in places like Utah and Nebraska and Mississippi were much more likely to open. In retrospect, red America got that decision right, and blue America got it wrong. I’d love to see a little bit more self-reflection from the epidemiologists at these leading universities who led us down such a wrong path.
- Harvard just released a report from its graduating seniors. Only a third of them felt fully comfortable speaking about their honest views in class. And moderate and conservative students were particularly unlikely to feel that way.
- As for what they should do now, look, by the time Trump comes for your university, it’s probably too late. You face really unpleasant choices. I think that universities should get their own house in order. I think they should acknowledge that they’ve been too weak about disciplining students. They should acknowledge that they’ve allowed students to protest while hiding their identity. The original laws in this country saying that you can’t protest by hiding your identity were meant to restrict the Ku Klux Klan. So, there are a whole set of things that I think universities can do.
- I’ve had conversations recently with pretty liberal, progressive professors at Columbia who’ve told me how for some of their progressive colleagues denying Israel’s right to exist is tantamount to required thought for students. It’s like the price of admission.
