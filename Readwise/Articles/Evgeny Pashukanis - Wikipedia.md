## Highlights
- In 1924, Pashukanis published his seminal work, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*. This is best known for Pashukanis' formulation of the "[Commodity Exchange Theory of Law](/wiki/Commodity_form_theory "Commodity form theory")". This theory was built on two pillars of [Marxist](/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") thought: (1) in the organization of society the economic factor is paramount; legal and moral principles and institutions therefore constitute a kind of [superstructure](/wiki/Base_and_superstructure "Base and superstructure") reflecting the economic organization of society; and (2) in the finally achieved state of [communism](/wiki/Communism "Communism"), law and the state will wither away. If communism is achieved, [morality](/wiki/Morality "Morality") as it is typically understood will cease to perform any function.
