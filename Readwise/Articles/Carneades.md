## Highlights
- According to tradition, Carneades also delivered a pair of lectures
  while in Rome, speaking in defense of justice on one day and, in
  rebuttal of his own arguments of the previous day, against it on the
  following day.
- Like Arcesilaus (316/15–241/40 BCE), the head of the Academy who
  was responsible for the school’s so-called ‘skeptical
  turn’
- The influence he exerted in this way was immense
- Philo of Larissa
- hilosophical
  activity in the Academy and among the philosophers in its orbit
  consisted in good part in the further development of ideas and lines
  of argument pioneered or substantially reshaped by Carneades
- Born in Cyrene, then a Greek-speaking city on the Mediteranean coast
  of North Africa,
- Histories of philosophy typically speak, as I did above, of a
  ‘skeptical turn’ in the Academy or of the ‘skeptical
  Academy’. Ancient authors called the school of Arcesilaus and
  his successors the ‘New Academy’ to distinguish it from
  the ‘Old Academy’ of his predecessors.
- On a strictly dialectical interpretation, the skeptical propositions
  for which the Academics argued need not tell us anything about what
  philosophical views, if any, they accepted themselves. The skeptical
  position that comprises these two claims—that knowledge is not
  possible and that one ought to suspend judgement about
  everything—is an unwelcome consequence of Stoic views and
  presents the Stoics with a problem that it is their responsibility to
  solve, not the Academy’s
