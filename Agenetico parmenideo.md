[[Fernando Rielo ]] frequently refers to identity in [[Parmenides]]' thought  as *agenetico parmenideo*.
Indeed in [[Parmenides]] [[Fragment 8 Parmenide]] there is the profound PArmenide's vision of the being as something that cannot be born and cannot die. 

[[Parmenides]] discovers that all beings are relatives of the same family. Outside the family there is the absolute nothing. The non-existent.
This "to be relative" of beings is so strong that beings are just "names" of the same eternal, agenetic, to be.

But in the Rielo's thinking agenetico Parmenideo refers to the non capability of "being" to give out to sprout out, to begets anything, to be relational with anything. In [[Parmenides]] this *geneticidad* is impossible Because everything is already part of the beins. 
Being as not future and not past, so it has no movement and without movement for Greeks there is no time and of course no generation.
