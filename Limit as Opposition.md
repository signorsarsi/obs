"Everygood thing, in so far it has no element of the opposite in itself, has limitlessgood. The reason for this is that, in general, things may only be limited by their opposites-a truthverifiedin particularexamples.Power is limited by the weaknessthat encompassesit, life by death, light by darkness and, in general,every good thing is restrictedby its opposite" in [[Gregory of Nissa]] [[Contra Eunomium]]


It seems that for Gregory of Nissa the [[Limit]] consists in  opposition. For this Reason God who is without any opposition has no limit. 

It would be interesting research the same issue in Greek Culture  for example [[Apeiron]] in [[Anaximander]]

At the same time we must recall famous [[Hegel]]'s statement [[Negatio est determinatio]]

Even for [[Rene Guenon]] into his [[# The Multiple States of the Being]]  in Chapter 1 the idea of [[Infinite]]corresponds to the idea of lack of limits in means illimitate. Indeed no limits (from the word [[Limen and Limes]]) recalls no finite from the word   [[finis]]
