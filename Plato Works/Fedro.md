\[274e] καλῶς δοκοῖ λέγειν, τὸ μὲν ἔψεγεν, τὸ δ᾽ ἐπῄνει. πολλὰ μὲν δὴ περὶ ἑκάστης τῆς τέχνης ἐπ᾽ ἀμφότερα Θαμοῦν τῷ Θεὺθ λέγεται ἀποφήνασθαι, ἃ λόγος πολὺς ἂν εἴη διελθεῖν: ἐπειδὴ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς γράμμασιν ἦν, ‘τοῦτο δέ, ὦ βασιλεῦ, τὸ μάθημα,’ ἔφη ὁ Θεύθ, ‘σοφωτέρους Αἰγυπτίους καὶ μνημονικωτέρους παρέξει: **μνήμης τε γὰρ καὶ σοφίας φάρμακον ηὑρέθη.’**  ὁ δ᾽ εἶπεν: ‘ὦ τεχνικώτατε Θεύθ, ἄλλος μὲν τεκεῖν δυνατὸς τὰ τέχνης, ἄλλος δὲ κρῖναι τίν᾽ ἔχει μοῖραν βλάβης τε καὶ ὠφελίας τοῖς μέλλουσι χρῆσθαι: καὶ νῦν ’
[274e] or disapproved. The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, “This invention, O king,” said Theuth, “will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.” But Thamus replied, “Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;

IL concetto di scrittura come farmaco della memora. Nel Fedro Socrate ricorda il mito del Dio Teuth (inventore della geometria e dell'alfabeto), che presento la grande scoperta della scrittura al Re Egiziano Thamus. Ma questi non lo lodò per la scoperta della scrittura. Perchè essa  non  il farmaco della memoria ma della

[275a] and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem
