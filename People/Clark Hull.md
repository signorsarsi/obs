**Clark Leonard Hull** (May 24, 1884 – May 10, 1952) was an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans "Americans") [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist "Psychologist") who sought to explain [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning "Learning") and [motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation "Motivation") by scientific laws of [behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior "Behavior"). Hull is known for his debates with [Edward C. Tolman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_C._Tolman "Edward C. Tolman"). He is also known for his work in [drive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_theory "Drive theory").

Hull spent the mature part of his career at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"), where he was recruited by the president and former-psychologist, [James Rowland Angell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rowland_Angell "James Rowland Angell"). He performed research demonstrating that his theories could predict behavior. His most significant works were the _Mathematico-Deductive Theory of Rote Learning_ (1940), and _Principles of Behavior_ (1943), which established his analysis of animal learning and [conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning "Classical conditioning") as the dominant learning theory of its time. Hull's model is expressed in biological terms: Organisms suffer deprivation; deprivation creates needs; needs activate drives; drives activate behavior; behavior is goal directed; achieving the goal has survival value.

He is perhaps best known for the ["goal gradient"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_pursuit#Goal_Gradient_Hypothesis "Goal pursuit") effect or hypothesis, wherein organisms spend disproportionate amounts of effort in the final stages of attainment of the object of drives. Due to the lack of popularity of [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism") in modern contexts it is little referenced today or bracketed as obsolete.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Nonetheless, a _[Review of General Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_General_Psychology "Review of General Psychology")_ survey, published in 2002, ranked Hull as the 21st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Early life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life")\]

Hull was born in a log house in [Akron, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_New_York "Akron, New York") on May 24, 1884.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> He was born to a powerful father who was known to have a violent temper.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> His father was largely uneducated and married his mother, a shy woman from Connecticut, when she was 15.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> Clark's father didn't get a lot of schooling because his father worked a lot as a child, so he didn't learn how to read and was eventually taught by his wife. At the age of three or four, Hull and his family moved to a farm in [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan "Michigan").<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> Here, he and his younger brother, Wayne, helped the farm by performing manual labor and chores around the house.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

Hull was educated at a small, one room school in the village of Sickels where there were about twenty to thirty people.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> He often missed school to help work on the farm.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> He displayed an early proficiency for mathematics, but found grammar a bit difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> When he was 11 or 12, he was forcibly converted by a religious group known as the Christian Crusaders.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> This experience caused him to rethink his religious identity, eventually [renouncing religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism") entirely.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> At the age of 17, he passed a teacher's examination test and became a teacher in a similar small schoolhouse.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> A combination of his religious crisis and his experience teaching inspired him to seek further education.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> He attended a high school in west [Saginaw County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saginaw_County "Saginaw County"), living with the superintendent of schools in exchange for household chores.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> Hull's atheism almost caused the superintendent to kick him out, but his wife got him to reconsider.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> After completing high school, Hull left the superintendent, but kept in contact with him until his death.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Higher education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Higher education")\]

After completing high school, Hull went on to study at [Alma Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_College "Alma College").<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> He continued to excel in mathematics, particularly geometry.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> His interest in geometry inspired him to begin thinking about how the mind can create new connections based on what is already known.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> It was during his time at Alma Academy that he read the works of [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza"), who he admired, though ultimately disagreed with.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> As he was about to graduate from the academy, he attended a banquet where the food was contaminated, and contracted a near deadly case of [typhoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid "Typhoid"), which delayed his return to college.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> Many died during that time and Clark himself almost died. He was left with permanent amnesia and a general bad memory for names which affected him throughout the rest of his life.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> As Clark's health improved, he returned to Alma College, where he studied math, physics, and chemistry, intending to become an engineer.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-frie_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-frie-6">[6]</a></sup> His intent was to qualify for a mining engineering program at another institution.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

After two years at Alma College, Hull moved to [Hibbing, Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibbing,_Minnesota "Hibbing, Minnesota") to work as an apprentice mining engineer.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> However, after two months he was afflicted by [polio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio "Polio"), which left him paralyzed with one leg, causing him to recover at his parents home for a year and forcing him to reconsider his life path.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> He considered becoming a minister of [Unitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism "Unitarianism"), because he found their [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") focused sermons appealing.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> His love of philosophy eventually led to his interest in Psychology, which he studied during his recovery.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> He began his journey by reading [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James "William James")’ _[The Principles of Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Psychology "The Principles of Psychology")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> He also took a particular interest in the works of [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson "John B. Watson") and [Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_P._Pavlov "Ivan P. Pavlov").<sup id="cite_ref-frie_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-frie-6">[6]</a></sup> A little after he started reading, his eyes would become weak and his mother would read to him until his eyes became strong enough for him to read on his own. A year later, he decided to teach back home in the one room school, which had expanded to two-rooms. After his two years teaching, he married Bertha Iutzi with very little money.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> After marrying Bertha Iutzi, they both began attending the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan").<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> Here he began his formal study of psychology and graduated with his [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree") in 1913.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> After teaching in Kentucky, Hull accepted a teaching assistant position at the [University of Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin "University of Wisconsin") under [Joseph Jastrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Jastrow "Joseph Jastrow") in order to join their graduate program.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> While taking classes and working, he privately worked on research based on the evolution of concepts, which he later applied to his dissertation, "Quantitative Aspects of the Evolution of Concepts."<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> After graduating, he spent some time working as a half-time assistant and eventually teaching as a full-time instructor at the University of Wisconsin before moving on to Yale.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Career")\]

In 1929 he began employment at Yale University, where he would serve as a [Sterling Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Professor "Sterling Professor") until his death. In addition to his other teachings, he was able to teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Hull went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Hull focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in addition to the premedical course. Hull had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for, _Principles of Behavior_.

## Death\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Death")\]

He died on May 10, 1952, in [New Haven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven "New Haven"), [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut "Connecticut").

## Research\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Research")\]

Hull's primary interest was in theories of learning and behaviors that lead to learning. This was the goal of most of his research; in the end Hull created his own learning theory sometimes referred to as drive theory or systematic behavior theory. He also showed interest in hypnosis, but this was not his top priority in his work and research life.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup> In both his drive theory and hypnosis research, Hull made sure that his experiments were under strict control. Also, in his work he emphasized quantitative data so everything could be analyzed more precisely, and less open to interpretation than previous studies on the topics.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup>

### Aptitude training\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Aptitude training")\]

Hull began working in aptitude testing after he began teaching [Daniel Starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Starch "Daniel Starch")'s class at the University of Wisconsin.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> His interest in the field was stimulated by his dissatisfaction with contemporary tests, believing them to be lacking in procedure and validity.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> His book on the subject, _Aptitude Testing_ (1928), showed his work with analyzing validity and creating scale scores.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> He also created his own test, the Wisconsin Lathe Test.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> He created a computing machine to lessen the work of producing tables of test correlations.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> The machine interpreted data from punch cards to produce these tables.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> This machine would later influence his theories on behaviorism.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> Hull eventually became cynical regarding the future of the field, causing him to pursue other interests.<sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup> Though no longer doing active research in the field, he retained an interest, debating [Karl Lashley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lashley "Karl Lashley")'s beliefs on the [heritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability "Heritability") of intelligence.<sup id="cite_ref-HistBook_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-HistBook-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Hypnosis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hypnosis")\]

Hull is often credited with having begun the modern study of [hypnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis "Hypnosis"). He became interested in the field while taking over a pre-medical course on psychology from Jastrow.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hypno_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hypno-9">[9]</a></sup> After successfully putting a disturbed student into a trance with a gifted hypnotic crystal, he began to research the phenomenon and its medical applications.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hypno_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hypno-9">[9]</a></sup> Dissatisfied with the unscientific nature of the field, Hull sought to bring greater academic rigor through measuring behavior instead of relying on self-reports.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hypno_9-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hypno-9">[9]</a></sup> While teaching, he encouraged his students to do their research with hypnosis, teaching them the techniques involved.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup>

His work _Hypnosis and Suggestibility_ (1933) was a rigorous study of the phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 188">: 188 </span></sup>  Hull's studies demonstrated emphatically once and for all that hypnosis is not related to sleep ("hypnosis is not sleep, … it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation"). His research even goes as far as to say that hypnosis is the opposite of sleep, because he found that hypnosis gave responses linked to alertness rather than lethargy. In Hull's research, some of his subjects even felt that hypnotism made their sensitivity and alertness better.<sup id="cite_ref-Krout_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Krout-11">[11]</a></sup> In fact, many of Hull's subjects in hypnotic states did believe that their senses had increased.<sup id="cite_ref-Young_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Young-12">[12]</a></sup> They genuinely thought their senses were better, but this was never proven to be a significant result. The main question of Hull's study was to examine the veracity of the apparently extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements of [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition") or the senses by hypnosis.

Hull's research indicated that hypnotic states and waking states are the same, besides a few simple differences. One of these differences is that subjects in hypnotic states respond to [suggestions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestion "Suggestion") more readily than those in a waking state. The only other notable difference is that Hull believed that those in hypnotic states were better able to remember events that had happened far in the subject's past.<sup id="cite_ref-Young_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Young-12">[12]</a></sup> Other than those two differences, not much differentiated between waking and hypnotic states, according to Hull's controlled studies.

Hull's experiments showed the reality of some classical phenomena such as mentally induced pain reduction and apparent inhibition of [memory recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_recall "Memory recall"). However, Hull's work indicated that these effects could be achieved without hypnosis being considered as a distinct state, but rather as a result of suggestion and motivation, which was a forerunner of the behavioral study of hypnosis. Similarly, moderate increases of certain physical capacities and changes to the threshold of sensory stimulation could be induced psychologically; attenuation effects could be especially dramatic.

After moving to Yale, his work in hypnosis quickly encountered resistance.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-HistBook_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-HistBook-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hypno_9-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hypno-9">[9]</a></sup> The medical school's concern over the dangers of hypnosis caused him to discontinue his research.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-HistBook_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-HistBook-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hypno_9-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hypno-9">[9]</a></sup>

### Behavior\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Behavior")\]

Clark Hull found inspiration for his own theory of learning after learning about [Ivan Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov "Ivan Pavlov")’s idea of conditional reflexes, and [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson "John B. Watson")’s system of behaviorism.<sup id="cite_ref-Hilgard_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hilgard-13">[13]</a></sup> He also was impacted by [Edward Thorndike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thorndike "Edward Thorndike"), as he adapted his theory to include and agree with Thorndike's law of effect.<sup id="cite_ref-Hilgard_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hilgard-13">[13]</a></sup> After Hull discovered his interest in learning theories from Pavlov, Watson, and Thorndike, he dedicated much of his own laboratory work to perfecting his own theory. Also, many experiments concerning his learning theory came from Hull's students, who carried out many different experiments in Hull's lab after finding inspiration from seminars and lectures in classes that Hull taught.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup>

Quantification was a chief concern of Hull's studies, and he continued to apply this interest to behaviorism.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Obit_4-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Obit-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-HistBook_8-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-HistBook-8">[8]</a></sup> While interested in the work of Watson, he was not entirely convinced. After listening to lectures by [gestalt psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology "Gestalt psychology") [Kurt Koffka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka "Kurt Koffka"), he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup> His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can be used to determine future behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-Autobio_3-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Autobio-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> His work with the computing machine led him to believe a machine could be built to replicate mental processes.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

In his book, _Principles of Behavior_,<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> he developed the following formula:

<sub>S</sub>E<sub>R</sub> = <sub>S</sub>H<sub>R</sub> × D × V × K

Where:  
<sub>S</sub>E<sub>R</sub> is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),  
<sub>S</sub>H<sub>R</sub> is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),  
D is drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc.),  
V is stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),  
and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).<sup id="cite_ref-HistBook_8-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-HistBook-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SR_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-SR-15">[15]</a></sup>

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. Eventually the formula became:

<sub>S</sub>E<sub>R</sub> = V x D x K x J x <sub>S</sub>H<sub>R</sub> - I<sub>R</sub> - <sub>S</sub>I<sub>R</sub> - <sub>S</sub>O<sub>R</sub> - <sub>S</sub>I<sub>R</sub>

such that I<sub>R</sub> is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),  
<sub>S</sub>I<sub>R</sub> is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over time).<sup id="cite_ref-SR_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-SR-15">[15]</a></sup> <sub>S</sub>L<sub>R</sub> is Reaction threshold, the smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning.

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup> Instead, he focused on continuously revising his original formula as exceptions showed up.<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

Hull's emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, and the nature of [habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology) "Habit (psychology)"), which he argued were associations between a [stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(psychology) "Stimulus (psychology)") and a response.<sup id="cite_ref-frie_6-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-frie-6">[6]</a></sup> Behaviors were influenced by goals that sought to satisfy [primary drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_reduction_theory_(learning_theory) "Drive reduction theory (learning theory)")—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His systematic behavior theory, also known as drive theory, is that of a [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement "Reinforcement") system, which means that in learning, habits are initially formed by reinforcing certain behaviors. Reinforcement of a response to a behavior supplies an effect that satisfies a need. In other words, this satisfaction of needs helps create habits out of behaviors. Specifically, Hull's theory posits that behaviors that satisfy needs, later described by Hull as cravings rather than needs, reduce these cravings. He called this concept [drive-reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_reduction_theory_(learning_theory) "Drive reduction theory (learning theory)"), or drive-stimulus reduction.<sup id="cite_ref-Hilgard_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hilgard-13">[13]</a></sup>

Other behaviorists found Hull's theories to be too cumbersome for practical use, leading to his work to be eclipsed by [Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner "B. F. Skinner").<sup id="cite_ref-Encyc_5-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Encyc-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Influence\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Influence")\]

In 1936 Hull worked with students and associates and together they started a series of evening seminars that became known as “Monday Night Meetings”. They would discuss topics such as conditioned reflexes, behavior laws, and Freud's psychoanalysis. These meetings became popular with many kinds of people, such as psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists and sometimes as many as seventy people would attend.<sup id="cite_ref-Beach_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Beach-16">[16]</a></sup> Later in life when Hull was in poor health, he had the help of his research assistants and volunteers to conduct his experiments. He also relied on people to keep him up to date on current discussions on current psychological experiments and theories that he was unable to attend and participate in.

Hull was one of the most frequently cited psychologists during the 1940s and 1950s.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup> _Aptitude Testing_ (1928) was a widely quoted textbook and his work _Hypnosis and Suggestibility: An Experimental Approach_ (1933) was widely studied. Hull's _Principles of Behavior_ (1943) was one of the most widely cited books in psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup> In an old _Handbook of Experimental Psychology_, his work was mentioned on over eighty pages, which was more than all other scientists at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup> In previous issues of the _[Journal of Experimental Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Experimental_Psychology "Journal of Experimental Psychology")_ and the _[Psychological Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review "Psychological Review")_ over forty percent of the bibliographies included one or more of his writings.<sup id="cite_ref-Hovland_7-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Hovland-7">[7]</a></sup>

Hull advised and inspired a number of graduate students and psychologists that went on to revise his theories and make contributions to the field of psychology. Some of these important people influenced by Hull were [Albert Bandura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura "Albert Bandura"), [Neal Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Miller "Neal Miller"), [John Dollard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dollard "John Dollard"), [Kenneth Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Spence "Kenneth Spence"), and [Janet Taylor Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Taylor_Spence "Janet Taylor Spence").<sup id="cite_ref-Beach_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Beach-16">[16]</a></sup>

[John Dollard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dollard "John Dollard") taught anthropology, psychology and sociology at Yale and was interested in studying social class and specific learning experiences. [Neal Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Miller "Neal Miller") studied under Hull at Yale, which is where he earned his Ph.D. Miller also founded the Laboratory of Physiological Psychology at Rockefeller University in New York, which is where he conducted research on animal training and this work helped to develop biofeedback.<sup id="cite_ref-Coons_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Coons-17">[17]</a></sup> Miller and Dollard collaborated and developed a social learning theory that was successfully applied to psychotherapy and understanding. Their book, _Social Learning and Imitation_, listed the four fundamentals necessary for instrumental learning. These were drive, cue, response and reward and were based on Hull's drive reduction theory of learning.<sup id="cite_ref-Sahakian_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Sahakian-18">[18]</a></sup> They used a similar construct to Hull's theory, however, they proposed that any strong stimulus could have motivating or drive properties without essentially being tied to the need of that particular organism.<sup id="cite_ref-Sonoma.edu_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Sonoma.edu-19">[19]</a></sup> Their book, _Personality and Psychotherapy_ (1950) is considered to be a very important book for it combined Hullian learning theory with psychoanalysis and helped to lay the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy.

[Kenneth Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Spence "Kenneth Spence") was one of the most well-known of Hull's graduate students. He developed and extended Hull's neo-behaviorist theory into what came to be called the Hull-Spence theory of conditioning, learning, and motivation. This theory states that people learn stimulus-response associations when a stimulus and response occur together, and reinforcement motivates the person to engage in the behavior and increases the occurrence of the learned behavior.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Spence contributed to the study of incentive motivation and developing mathematical formulation and equations to describe learning acquisition.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Spence attributed improvement in performance to motivational factors rather than the habit factors of Hull's theory. He believed that reinforcement was not always necessary for learning to occur and that people can learn through latent learning.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> He also developed a discrimination learning theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Complete_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Biography_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Complete_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Biography-20">[20]</a></sup> His discrimination theory suggests that there are gradients of excitatory and inhibitory potential that are generated around the values of the stimulus that are either reinforced or not.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

[Janet Taylor Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Taylor_Spence "Janet Taylor Spence") began her research while working as a graduate student with Kenneth Spence at the University of Iowa. Kenneth became her husband in 1960. Her research was on anxiety and was an extension of the Hull-Spence hypothesis. She studied anxiety as a dispositional trait, or “drive”, which is the component of Hull's motivational theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Janet_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Janet-21">[21]</a></sup> She predicted that people with higher anxiety levels would show higher levels of eyelid conditioning than those with lower levels of anxiety.<sup id="cite_ref-Janet_21-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Janet-21">[21]</a></sup> Spence then developed her own instrument to measure her hypothesis, the [Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Manifest_Anxiety_Scale "Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale").<sup id="cite_ref-Janet_21-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Janet-21">[21]</a></sup> Her later research focused primarily on elaborating Hull's drive theory.<sup id="cite_ref-Janet_21-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Janet-21">[21]</a></sup>

## Awards and recognition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Awards and recognition")\]

Hull has been honored by a number of scientific societies. Hull was president of the [American Psychological Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association "American Psychological Association") from 1935 to 1936.<sup id="cite_ref-Beach_16-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_L._Hull#cite_note-Beach-16">[16]</a></sup> Hull was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1935 and also to the National Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1936. Hull received the Warren Medal during 1945 from the [Society of Experimental Psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Experimental_Psychologists "Society of Experimental Psychologists").

## Legacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clark_L._Hull&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Legacy")\]

Hull's ideas were so appealing in part because of his professional background in engineering. He was very good with math and numbers, and incorporated his numerical knowledge into the field of psychology. He followed the acceptable understanding of psychology at that time, and was influenced by the work and the conclusions of the pioneers of [Behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism") ([Edward Thorndike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thorndike "Edward Thorndike"), [John B. Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson "John B. Watson"), and [Ivan Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov "Ivan Pavlov")).

However, Hull was able to add his own twist to understanding reinforcement and learning in a way that had never been done before by putting everything in numbers and equations. Hull was also influenced by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")’s work. Hull contributed to the motivation domain of psychology. He had quantified the Drive concept in an equation to prove that habit strength is a function of reinforcement.

[Edward C. Tolman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_C._Tolman "Edward C. Tolman") was a contemporary of Hull whose theory of learning was proved to be more logical and less complicated than Hull's work. Tolman showed that behavior is goal directed and not controlled by random drives and reinforcement. Tolman used maze experiments with rats to show that rats can learn without reinforcement and are better understood as directed by goals and driven by cognitive expectancies. This finding provided a serious challenge to much of Hull's learning theory.
