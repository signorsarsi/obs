Document which Eutropius and Paulus conferred to [[Agostino d'Ippona|Augustinus]]. The document was circulating in Sicily

[[Caelestius]] Tesis

1. If sin cannot be avoided it is not sin (neither philosophy  
nor justice would allow the name of sin, which implies moral  
responsibility, to that which is absolutely inevitable). If it  
can be avoided, man can live without sin.  
2. If sin comes from necessity, it is not sin; if from free will  
it can be avoided.  
3. If sin is an essential part of human nature, it ceases to  
be sin; if an accidental, it can be avoided.
4. If sin is a substance,  it must be created by God. Such  
a statement is blasphemous. Sin therefore is not a substance existing of itself but something which men do. But if so it is  
something which they might not do, that is, it can be avoided.  
5. An "ought" implies a "can." A man ought to live  
without sin : therefore he can.  
6. The injunction to live without sin implies its possibility.  
7. God wills us to live without sin: the will of God must be capable of fulfilment.  
8. God does not will us to live with sin : it is blasphemous to suppose then that he would create man incapable of living without sin. 
9. If sin comes from natural necessity, it is not blameworthy;  
if from our free decision  it can be avoided for God would not  
give us a will inclined to evil rather than good.
10. God made man good and commanded him to be good.  It is  blasphemous to say that man is evil and incapable of good.  
11. Sin consists  in " leaving undone those things which  
ought to be done and in  doing those things  which ought not to  
be done." The very statement makes clear that it is possible  
to do the former and refrain from the latter.  
12. If man's alleged inability to be free from sin comes from  
nature, it is not sin. If from will, will may be changed by will.
13. If the  inability comes from outside, he is not responsible;  
if from inside he is not responsible for a failure to be what his  
very nature prohibits him from being.  
14. It is heretical to deny the goodness of human nature(The mention of the Manicheans at this point is significantly  directed against Augustine) . But to say that human nature  
cannot be free from the evil of sin is to do precisely that.
15. God  would _not be just if He held against any man as  
a sin something which that man could not avoid.
16. Each of us can be without sin, though we are not. But if we examine why, we freely admit that the fault is ours.
